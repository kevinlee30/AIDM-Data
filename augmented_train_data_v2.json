Not only is it adjustable for any size head but it is worn around the back of the head so it isnt as noticeable as other options.  Since it is worn around the back of the head/neck it also keeps your neck warm too.  Compared to other ear muffs I have seen the Ear Grip wont make you look like a fairy.  There is no fluff/wild colors/fur here and you are still able to hear out of them.  They are made with a plastic loop that is covered with fabric.  The loop corresponds with your ear so the hole lines up with your ear and the fabric thats covering it is more than enough to keep you warm.   You can also take them off in a flash and compact them with a push and turn so they will fit in any pocket.  I highly reccomend them",

        "reviews": "This is truly a beautiful bag!  I got the classic dark leather, which is exactly the rich brown shown in the pictures.  The leather has a wonderful grain that adds to the bag's character.  The leather is thicker than I expected; while it is by no means stiff, it is not ultra-soft, ultra-thin butter leather.  This is leather that will age well and last for many, many years.  The zippers are matte silver metal so not only do they look great against the brown leather, they'll be durable.  (The other hardware is the same type of matte/antiqued silver.)  The bag is lined with a heavy khaki twill that is just a shade or two lighter than the strap.  The cotton strap not only adds to the bag's uniqueness, it also keeps the bag from sliding when you bend over. (I wear it across my chest like a messenger bag.) Inside there are two small pockets on the divider separating the two sections of the bag.  One is gusseted and works well for a cell phone (or items of a similar size) and the other is suitable only for small flat items such as business cards; I would have really liked for my iPod to snuggle in that second pocket but something that thick won't fit.  The internal sections of the bag are large enough to hold a notebook, file or book but the bag is smaller than most of the other messenger bags I've tried because they were sized for laptops. I actually use it as a purse and it has plenty of room for all of my junk and the ubiquitous book. On the outside, each end of the bag has a pocket that has a vertical row of stitching bisecting it.  This creates 2 tall, thin pockets where I keep pens; it would have been nice if one side didn't have that row of stitching so that it could hold larger items, but that's not a problem for me.  The entire back side of the bag is another zippered pocket.  On the front flap is a small zippered pocket that turns out to be a good home for a cell phone because you can get to it quickly without going into the bag.  The magnetic closure on the flap is sufficiently strong.  There are 2 magnets in the body of the bag and in the flap there is a metal bar running the width of the flap so you don't have to worry about lining up magnets to close the bag.  I've had the bag only a few days and have already received compliments.  Though the bag is pricey, it is obviously crafted with care from high-quality materials.  It also has a very distinctive look.  I am very happy with this purchase and have already added another Diongini bag to my Amazon Wish List",

I began wearing them in 1978, when they were sold under the French Shriner label and have not been without at least two pair ever since.  The design and production rights (thankfully) passed or were sold to Florsheim when the French Shriner marque disappeared.  \n\nThe shoes are the ULTIMATE IN COMFORT!  The uppers are of glove-soft kidskin and the soles of a firmly cushioned synthetic material.  They are suitable for everyday office wear as well as for use on formal occasions.\n\nThe factory finish is as durable as a patent leather, without the extremely high gloss plastic look.  \n\nThey are extremely durable, as some of them lasted me for more than twelve years of frequent wear.  I've never been able to wear out the one piece Comfortech sole and heel.  Ultimately, the uppers will wear through on the flex creases or at the base, where the upper is joined to the sole.  You can easily extend the wear period to ten years or more by occasional use of a good polish, especially after the shoes have been exposed to a wet environment.\n\nThey are an excellent buy at the suggested retail price of $100 to $110 that you see most often, but are an unbelievable bargain at the $90/pair charged by Amazon.\n\nIf I had a suggestion for minor improvement for Florsheim, it would be to make the sole slightly thicker and the heel slightly wider for greater stability.\n\nI personally, would rate these shoes at six stars on a scale that had five stars for the next best shoe.  I would never go back to wearing dress shoes of conventional stiff leather and hard soles and heels.\n\nThese shoes are not perfect, but Florsheim has come VERY close with the Riva.\n\nGive them a try -- I think you will come to love them as I do!\n\nNeil Coddington\nAlbuquerque",

        "reviews": "I live up in the mountains in a state that is ferociously cold when Winter roars in, and it has been doubly so in the last month: temperatures have dipped down into the subzero icebox range, to the point where I feel like Nanook of the North, tempted to bundle up with a balaclava, buy a sled, hire a team of huskies, and go mushing across the frozen highways and streets. \n\nI don't mind it. Actually, as a refugee from NYC (which post-9/11 and the Bloomberg anti-Smoking Nazis is not half the brazen City it once was), I chose Utah because of the snow, the mountains, the free & easy gun laws, fewer people, and skiing. But what I don't dig is the Arctic temperatures, especially because I have an evening cigar outside every night, and it dampens the delights of cigar-smoking to have your face and eyeballs freeze. \n\nWhat to do? \n\nI took a page from the strategy-book of Chiapan Revolutionary & mask-wearing bandito SubCommandante Marcos, who wears his hairy woolly black face-shrouding balaclava wherever he goes. I dig the SubCommandante; dig his style, dig his stature, dig his designer AKs, dig his Listening Tour about the country taken on a black motorbike, a kind of 21st century homage to Che. Dig all if it, Comrade, you know? \n\nBut what I dig most of all is his ability to light & smoke his stogie through the little mouth-hole in his black balaclava. He does this all the time: there's SubCommandante, with his stogie, and he's got it sticking out of the little mouthhole, puffing away on it merrily. \n\nSo I figured: if it works for El Jefe down in Chiapas where it's 105 degrees in the shade, it probably will work wonders for me up in the mountains of Utah, where it's 5 below zero beneath the moon? Ya venceremos! \n\nSure enough, I'm digging it: I can go outside, smoke my cigar to my heart's content, and have a toasty face that doesn't freeze & splinter in the subzero frore winter blast. All well & good, even though after a few heady puffs the little mouth aperture gets a wee tad bit stinky, but oh well, that's what a washing machine was made for. Also, the ski-mask is well made, solidly sewn, and no doubt would be awesome for a cold-weather counterinsurgency. \n\nThat said, there is one big drawback: every time I wear the thing, I have an urge to carry out guerilla warfare against the bourgeois pig McMansion owner over the fence. \n\nJS",

It is cute on both sides (the solid white side with navy stitching and navy mesh back, and the solid navy mesh side), and it's the rare white sports bra that I would feel comforable wearing alone on runs outside -- the double layering with the navy mesh keeps it from being see-through even when drenched in sweat.  Speaking of sweat, even after a hard workout this sports bra kept me feeling dry and comfortable, as well as secure.  The only slight drawback is the small reflective label in the middle of the back - it felt slightly scratchy when I first put the sports bra on, but I forgot all about it within a few minutes of starting my workout and didn't feel any scratching from that point onward.  I imagine that with repeated washings, even the initial slight scratchiness would disappear.  And even though this item did not ship directly from amazon, shipping was fast from essentialapparel and I had no problems",

        "reviews": "This case will (barely) hold my 5.1 MP Sony Cybershot digital camera in the large zippered pouch.  The small zippered pouch is nicely configured for holding extras like batteries, extra memory sticks, etc, with the padded pouch and a webbed rear wall with velcro to secure the webbing -- giving two practical accessory sections. \n\nThe belt loop is well made, strong, well secured, and doesn't have velcro or snaps (which I hate, since I fear losing the camera that way), so this thing will stay on your belt, worry free. The zippers appear strong, and don't bind or act sticky. \n\nIt feels light and fits comfortably to my side or back via my belt. It is reasonably attractive as such bags go, especailly for the low price.  The display cardboard it came mounted on (I bought mine at a discount store) said it had a lifetime warranty, and it looks like it was made with a LONG life in mind).  The padding appears sufficient all around to resist normal bumps, etc.  (though I would fear a drop on concrete). \n\nI actually bought this to hold my tiny memory stick based MP3 player, and related accessories (I already have a similar bag for my camera).  When my Creative Muvo player's el-cheapo case that came with the player cracked badly and I feared it breaking completely, I wanted a cheap, durable, reasonably sized case.   I really wasn't able to find ANYTHING made for such a player.  Then I looked for small camera bags, figuring if I could pop the earbuds in with the winder and a couple extra batteries, I was set.  \n\nNow this is what I carry my MP3 player in.  It is easy to carry 1 to 5 extra AAA batteries and the player and the earbuds and winder.  The player stays dry, padded, and secure.  The very versatile zipper (two zippered tabs to leave any zipper hole where you want, and as big or small as you want) for the large pouch makes it perfect to let the earbud cord peek out without fear of any rain getting in. \n\n\nI think if you have a SMALL digital camera OR a SMALL MP3 player, and care more about functionality, durability, and a VERY reasonable price than the latest fashion fad -- you can't go wrong here. \n\nThe only three (small) drawbacks for tiny MP3 player use I can see are:\n\n1). I used a piece of bubble wrap to pad the player in the large pouch.  It was actually a bit big for the small pouch, and would flop around a lot in the big pouch. \n\n2). Of course, you can't get to the player controls when it is secured in this case.  This doesn't bother me as I generally just turn it on, adjust the volume to the circumstances, pick the music I want, close the pouch, and enjoy my music.  IF however, you want to fiddle with the player controls a lot, you WON'T like this solution. \n\n3).  Instead of a custom-made hole for the headphone/earbud cord, you need to use a zipper gap as described above. I see no practical harm, and in fact it makes where the \"virtual hole\" goes extremely versatile.  However, it may be a fashion \"disaster\" (which I couldn't care less about, personally).",

One of the metal ribs actually bent and broke in half, so it's pretty much a lost cause.\n\nThat said, this is an excellent umbrella. The auto-close feature is so handy if you're going to be in and out of the rain a lot, like going shopping on a rainy day. While everyone else is standing at the door, pulling their umbrellas shut, you just pop it down and go inside. I never had a problem with the open/close mechanism. The colors that this umbrella comes in are also so cheerful - mine was the bright green color.\n\nThe small size of this umbrella makes it easy to tuck into your purse (or man-bag) if you're not sure about the weather. It is a little heavy for such a small size, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nIf the rib of this umbrella hadn't broken so suddenly, I would have given this product 5 stars.

We'd had a bad experience with a stick on unit and wanted something that actually gave some real and solid protection. \n\nThese units are GREAT. They fit very well, they hold the 'pod solidly  in place and they're strong. We've both used them exclusively since they arrived. \n\nThere is one quirk that I'm experiencing by Hannah isn't. I may have to try one of the other colors to see if it's just the one I selected or a design issue. The \"tab\" that holds the two shell halves together protrudes slightly and when the 'pod lies flat on a surface, this tab tends to pop open. The one I've been using loses it's tension over a matter of days and the unit pops open unexpectedly. \n\nI'll try a different one to see if this is just a quirk on the one I've been using. I'd also likely file the protruding tab down by .040\" or so to help prevent the \"table contact.\" These things are good enough that it's well worth my effort to examine the engineering and find solutions. \n\nHowever, in the overall, I find these to be really excellent covers for our use and style.",

Material that wicks sweat away from the skin?  Sounded almost too good to be true, but I took a chance anyways.\n\nSo far I've used mine both hiking and cycling, with the latter getting so much use that I need to order more.  Despite the tightness of this shirt when you initially put it on, it stretches and breathes amazingly well.  I was a little leery with the two size charts and actually used Amazon's instead of the actual retailer who was selling the Under Armour product (Fogdog) and ended up just fine.  Works great for working out or any number of outdoor type activities which is what I use mine for.  Bottom line is that it breathes and stretches well, and is very comfortable.  I must also add that after several washings and even a bad spill while cycling, these shirts are amazingly durable!  I feel the price is definitely worth it, excuse me while I go order more",

In my opinion these boots DO NOT have \"heavy duty\" rubber soles at all but cheap soles that start to rub and crumble almost immediately under working conditions. There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying \"Made in China\" and that's it. The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact. All in all, if you are purchasing these boots for long term wear or work related activities I DO NOT reccomend them.

Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches. The idea of 'Medium' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards. My body fat is low. I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32 inches waist. Is that not 'Medium' sized? I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether. One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems. The draw string is fine. It allows flexibility. So what if your pants fall down? It seems to be the fashion, anyway. Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions. Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing. They looked like crap after the first time I washed them. I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again. My life partner told me they looked like 'old men's' underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry. I am not a mean hearted kind of guy. So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.",

        "reviews": "As an advanced exerciser, I am always looking for a new, innovative challenge. The Firm Body Sculpting Ball workout provides just that. This workout comes with a sculpting ball, which is available in three weights (four, six or eight pounds). I used the eight pound variety, and by the time we got to the ab work, I was ready to put the ball away! My arms really got a workout, as did my core. There are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you, over your head, and move it diagonally across your body. I could really feel it in my core after the workout.\n \nOnce we completed several segments of standing work, including grapevine, squats, and lunges, we go to the floor for bridge work and abs. You have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work, which I found challenging since by that time I was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me. You also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches, which is difficult with such a heavy ball. Afterwards is a short cool down, which I thought could have been longer.\n \nTina leads, and she is very fit and quite personable. She cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way. As with all the new Firm releases, the background is sterile and boring. There are four background exercisers, with Allison showing beginner moves. Allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves. The music is nice and non-intrusive.\n \nBeginners will enjoy this workout. It isn't complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout. Unless you're advanced and have some good upper body strength, I would not recommend the eight pound ball. You could injure yourself if you go to heavy. In fact, I was wishing I had another, lighter ball for the floor work.\n \nI have all eight new workouts, and I've done three so far. Of those, I liked this one the best. I felt I got a good workout, but I wish it were longer. The entire workout from start to finish is about 32 minutes long. Another 15 minutes would have been great, although I suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we'd kept going much longer. \n \nOverall, I give this workout high marks. It's definitely a keeper",

My only complaint is that the fly tends to fall open sometimes, because it's made without a fastener. The idea is for a sleeker feel, but it sacrifices security. Love 'em anyway",

Though thought of as some as \"80's\" \"Retro\" or what have you, Aviator sunglasses are like Chuck Taylor Converse shoes, like cowboy hats, like your favorite solid color T-shirt.  Its Americana, Classic, and Cool, which is what makes it buck the trend and stand the test of time.  I love my new shades.  They also come in a great hard-case so you can stow them anywhere and not worry about them getting damaged.  Beyond that even, why pay over 100 dollars for a pair of \"name brand\" sunglasses that are made of plastic when you can get something with sturdier, more durable metal frames?  Even beyond that, the UV rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I've ever worn, solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here, but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere, you are most likely wasting your money.

Now, the XI can be found at significant discount. The XI is one of the best Asics has made and the XII is probably the worst.  The XII is much lighter, but less of a stability shoe and certainly not durable and not made for a heavy runner.  I hope that the XIII is more like the XI and less like the XII.

Under nylon shorts, the Intimo silks managed to keep my Special Fun Area reasonably dry even while hiking in driving rain. When they did get wet, they dried much, much faster than cotton boxers do. \n\nThey lasted a couple of months before falling apart - a pretty good show of durability, actually, given the amount of punishment they took. I had only two pair and I alternated them, often with a full week between washings. Obviously they got kinda crusty, but that couldn't be helped. Under the circumstances they held up well. I would recommend them.\n\nAs for this boxer/brief/thong controversy, I believe a man should wear whatever type of underwear he finds most comfortable. If that means boxers, fine. If it means a thong, fine. What women consider stylish should be at the very bottom of a man's list of concerns. Women consider all kinds of ridiculous things stylish, such as hairless pets, square-toed shoes, pointy-toed shoes, the Monochromatic Look and the music of Andrea Bocelli",

This bra is relatively comfortable generally speaking, and it is VERY comfortable compared to minimizers and other \"hold'em up and hold'em in place\" bras. Personally, I think the svelt look of the bra is gorgeous.  With a big chest, I've never been able to wear those lacy little bras from Victoria's Secret, so this is actually a big improvement over what my husband refers to as \"industrial strength\" bras like our grandmothers wear. I only give it four stars because the underwire is not comfortable if you sit for long periods of time at a desk like I do; it begins to \"dig in\" a bit right beneath the rib cage.  Overall, it's a great bra to (1) hide nipples, (2) provide your breasts with a wonderfully rounded shape, (3) hides bra lines (great t-shirt bra), and (4) show off your cleavage but not the bra itself (if you wear a low cut blouse). I think you'll like it; and remember, you tend to get what you pay for these days.  The days of $18 bras are far behind us",

        "reviews": "The best Swim suit that I have ever seen in the US\n\nI strongly believe that this is the best Speedo suits that I have ever bought in this country. The swim suites being made of very soft and elastic fabric, it does not cause the itchiness on your waste, hips, and crotch, which usually happens when you put on small Speedos like this. The suits actually have only one inch cloth on the sides, you may move your legs in the water very easily, and it makes your swim performance far better than the other Speedos. Another good feature of this suit is that there are many variation of color. I own white, black and dark blue one. I personally do not recommend the one in white and very light color, since it become absolutely see-through when wet.\n\nI know there is one big concern when men wearing this suite. Here is my comment to someone who does not have confidence to wear them in swimming pool: To be frank, my friends told me that the suits are little revealing since those have high-leg cut and made of thin fabric. In fact, even in the darker colors, shape of your\"manhood\" will be somewhat revealed especially when wet in these suits. (But not see-through) However, don't you think it always happens when you are in any Speedos as long you have the \"organ?\" it is absolutely more strange if that part was completely flat. In addition, any swimming suits have more or less this feature. If you are a person who thinks that is unfavorable, you may want to stop swimming in pool and do the other work outs. In other words, people might see you package occasionally since it has high leg cut and adhere to your body. However who cares, stares, and makes fun of it all the time when you are in swimming pool? The suites cover only essential part because it was made to swim fast, but absolutely not to reveal your manhood and pull attention from others. Don't you agree?\n\n I recommend you to try it at least once if you are swimmers who seriously want to swim fast. The price being around $20, it is affordable as the second swim ware. I realized that the actual size of the waist of this suite might be a little bigger than the jeans or pants. Therefore, you will feel more comfortable if you buy a one size smaller. Like myself, I usually ware jeans or pants in the size of 29. Therefore I chose 28 and perfectly fit me. The fabric being elastic, it stretches a bit. However, if you worry about the size, just buy the exact size. I love this suit and ware it all at least once a week. As other people wrote previously, the color fades relatively fast in pool water. Therefore, I would suggest you buy two pairs and wear it in turns.",

Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  \n\nThe idea of \"Medium\" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.  Is that not \"Medium\" sized? \n\nI think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  \n\nThe draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.\n\nI wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like \"old men's\" underwear.

It's lightweight, the seams are all finished in a rough, peasant-y kind of way, and the gauze is, well, gauze-y.\n\nIt's a lovely dress. Grazes the ankle. Lots of give in the elastic midsection (order up a size if you're large-chested). \n\nMake sure you've got a good strapless bra, because you'll want to wear it off-shoulder",

However, there seems to be some inflexibility across the top of the shoe that can make pushing off when climbing inclines a slightly uncomfortable process.  I haven't owned the shoes very long so this may be a result of having to break them in. I do appreciate the covered toe which I feel is a very big bonus for this shoe - it's not obtrusive and doesn't ruin the look of the shoe at all, but definitely helps during the aforementioned pushing off during inclines in that the front of the shoe stays relatively undamaged.  The ankle support is good and hits right at the ankle bone so flexibility isn't impeded.  I live in a wet climate and have never had any issues with leaking, so the waterproof claim is reliable. Overall, for the price I'm very happy with the shoe and consider it a solid purchase",

I bought this style pantyhose in tan and I like very much how it looks on my legs and thighs when wearing a dress or skirt. \n\n   While in recent years I often need, for the sake of an appearance, to wear control top pantyhose, this style is among the most comfortable and nice looking sheer to waist pantyhose I have worn.

        "reviews": "It's October 8th, 2006.  The Detroit Tigers have just defeated the New York Yankees to advance to the American League Championship Series.   People counted the Tigers out.  Everyone thought the Yankees would walk into Comerica Ballpark and put a serious damper on the success the Tigers have produced all season long.  Nope.  Didn't happen.  The Tigers won 95 games this year.  No one thought the Tigers advancing this far was possible, but when you have excellent stars such as Magglio Ordonez, Curtis Granderson, Ivan Rodriguez, Marcus Thames, Craig Monroe and Kenny Rogers, you can't lose.  The manager Jim Leyland also played a major part in helping to reshape the Tigers as a team, and give them much-needed direction.  He was probably the main reason they won so many games.  \n\nThe Tigers are now a team EVERYONE can love- not just Detroit fans.  TV stations are now playing Tigers games again and reminding people that yes, the Tigers are still around.  The fact that the Tigers haven't been mentioned for the last 10 years shows that the fans may have forgotten all about the team, but beating the Yankees last night was solid proof the team is back, and threatening.  Proof that the Tigers can hang with the big boys.  \n\nThe celebration after the final out in game 4 was wonderful.  Everyone on the team lifted Jim Leyland on their shoulders and proudly walked around the field, while the fans celebrated and cheered indicating they still remember those successful championship years a long time ago, and obviously still support their home team.  It got extremely crazy when the team decided to spray champagne at the audience, and they enjoyed it!  Even a cop wanted to be sprayed.  The celebration supposedly lasted an hour.  \n\nThis Vintage Crest T-Shirt should PROUDLY be worn by you.  I want you to take a trip to New York City wearing this shirt and walk down the street so everyone can see how much of a proud, loyal Detroit Tigers fan you are.  The days of watching them lose game after game are finally over.  Long live the Tigers.  Make sure you buy this shirt to celebrate the wonderful run the Tigers had in the season of 2006.  You need to wear Orange if you live in the Detroit area.",

Stylish, practical, and comfortable.\n\nMy only complaints are: 1) The middle pocket - seen in the photo as holding a bottle of water - is a little deceptive.  This pocket does not comfortably hold a full-size water bottle, only a 1/2 pint bottle.  Had I known that, I might have ordered a larger size bag.  And 2) I agree with other reviewers that the exterior arch pocket should have velcro closure to securely hold your items, namely a cell phone.

The fur was not \"curly and fluffy\" like the Uggs, it was relatively short and not as soft. I called Bearpaw and complained and they assured me that they were not synthetic. But after several calls the owner told me \" they are not 100% sheepskin, they are blended with merino wool\" which is NOT stated anywhere on Amazon or their website. Also I am a designer/ decorator and I am very familiar with fabrics and fibers and I still say they're synthetic. I returned them, at my cost, and am waiting for a refund. You get what you pay for! I probably could have bought a better pair at Payless.\nWhat happened next: They promised me they would refund my money if I returned the boots at my cost, instead they sent them back to me with no refund.

This means the 5 star rating might be biased by the sheer pleasure of simply having something to feel like fitting in with the crowd, but to be fair and honest about this product...I admit it does look like a quality item.  \n\nIt's built practical, looks good, and (having to guess) I'd say it's probably better suited for college use rather than high school.  For some odd reason being in college doesn't require as many books to be carried in one day as I see what high school students have to carry.\n\nIf this bag was a dual set with each bag on opposite sides, it would seem to resemble the old-fashioned saddle bags (except it's not leather, is maybe a little bit larger in capacity, and has plenty of individual compartments and zippers).",

The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you).

The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe.

The style changed and the quality as well.  I would like an explanation and would like money back!   I am so sad that a great product is now less than mediocre",

But like I say, I'm not walking around with a heavy load for very long. \n\nNow! For the most awesome feature, once I'm in my hotel and my computer is on the desk where it will stay until time to go back to the airport, I have a stylish and simple all purpose canvas bag to put my book, scarf, notebook, or whatever.

Now that I have one, the benefits of having a slim multi-purpose bag far outweigh my desire for padding.\n\nThis bag fits the bill for dual purposes.

This is a smaller bag, ideal for using as a purse.  The straps are long enough to wear on the shoulder.  It has a hard insert in the bottom of the bag that is removeable so you can wash the bag.  It has a zipper closure so you won't lose any of your stuff.  For this price this bag is a steal, I'd definitely recommend it!",

Unfortunately I was told by PacificPlex that they were sold out of smalls in the white color (although they are selling them now).  I had to get my dress altered in the bust and waist (the length was perfect).  The material is not \"satin\" as stated but a satin-like polyester which is a bit see-through so definitely need a slip or something.  For the price it is still great.  \nI've been looking for my dress for months and couldn't find any that were slim fitting with a halter top so when I saw this dress (at only $119) I was pretty excited.  I've never bought clothes online and I'm not sure I will in the future but I am glad I bought this dress. \nI just wish PacificPlex would have told me they had more dresses on order(as I was still well within the 30 day refund guarantee).  It would have been cheaper to exchange than to get the alterations. Although my seamstress did say that based on how big the medium was on me, the small probably would have needed to be taken in as well.  Oh well, it fits and I'm happy now",

I've worn it jogging three times and it feels great.  No bounce and no pinching.  It held up great in the washing machine and dried really quickly.  Everything I've tried before this wonderful bra was way too flimsy and offered no support.  For years I've been looking for something that would hold everything in place while I ran a few miles and jogged up and down a few sets of stairs.  I think I'll get one of each support level and then I'll get one more of each.  It even has adjustable hooks in the elastic band around the chest, so as you lose those Lbs while wearing this great top, you'll be able to adjust it to fit you as you slim down.  I'll never have to search high and low again.  I'll know exactly where to turn whenever I need a sports bra that will support my \"needs\".  Thank you Figleaves, you really have a great product.  I hope that enough women find that these sports bras are a godsend and that we'll never have to wear ugly, cumbersome, pinching nightmares again",

But be warned, My daughters larger text books dont fit,nor does her mead trapper looseleaf or her nike portfolio. The top corner sticks out about two to three inches and zipper is unable to fully close, so she has to carry them in her hands; which kind of defeats the purpose of carrying a handsfree bag. Spiral notebooks and mead composition books(black and white) fit perfectly. \n\n...Another gripe is she is probably 100 pounds soaking wet, so the strap isn't flush to her body. Shes a tall slim 13 1/2 year old. It will fit the chubbies and the bustier girls a whole lot better. The velcor strip is short, so there isn't much more ability to adjust to make it tighter.\n\n...Samsonite can either make the strap shorter so it doesnt hit her booty when she walks or lenghten the amount of velcro they use so theres more ability to adjust the fit. We thought that during the colder months it might fit a little better with her winter coats, but it still hits her too low on her body. We'd rather it be a more snug fit. She still loves it though, because of the color and it holds all her stuff well...cell phone, ipod, keys, bus pass,pens etc. Minus 1/2 a star for size and fit. Overall great bag,4 1/2 stars",

The tongue is hurting my right foot and I'm concerned that I am going to need to return the shoes.  \n\n4:30pm I take the shoes off and it turns out that the tongue (which is connected to the sides of the top of the shoe where the laces go through)is not centered quite right so I fold it in place and put the shoes back on.  I notice a difference instantly.  My wife comes home from work and says \"I don't like the way they look....but they are your shoes\".\n\nBy 5:30 I don't care how they look because they are soooo comfortable.  The soft leather uppers seems to fit the foot perfectly and the soft sole is still really springy.  The combination of these two is magnificent.\n\nBy 7pm I love these shoes so much that I am sitting at the computer writing a review at amazon!\n\nI generally wear birkenstock and Dr. Marten shoes so I have spoiled my feet.  It is a fantastice surprise to get these shoes and find that they are even MORE comfortable than the Docs or the Birks.\n\nI just ordered a pair of the Desert treks....",

I had purchased this item after trying out one of the silcone skins that ripped apart after about 3 months of use.  I use my MP3 player when I go running and so I need an armband product that can withstand the elements and my running.  \n\nAfter using this product only 3 times, it began to fall apart as follows:\n\n1.  The protective screen cover is nothing but a flimsly piece of plastic that is glued to the case.  It basically falls apart when you try and squeeze your vision M into the case. \n2.  There are these oddly placed velcro dots on the armband that are used to secure it after you wrap it around your arm.  The huge design flaw is that the dots needs to line up on top of one another in order to be secure.  So, if you arm is an odd sign you end up having to make it tighter in order to align the dots.  If you're in the market for a tourniquet, then you should buy this product. \n3.  If you sweat at least a drop while you exercise or run (if you don't then you're not really exercising), the velcro dots lose their stick-um.  I discovered that the fuzzy part of the velcro was glued onto the armband.  As it heats up from your body temperature rising, it literally melts and causes the dots to fall off.  It was because of this that my MP3 player almost flew off my arm and onto the cement.  \n\nSo, if you are looking to shatter your MP3 player, then buy this nifty product.

Wallets are one of those items that has to be just right.  When I read the description, I thought this one would be a pretty good replacement, and it has been, for the most part.  The zipper and zipper pull seem nice and strong.  When you open it, there is a card section with room for 9 credit cards but I doubled some up, and it does work to have 2 per slot.  There is a place under the credit card slots to put receipts or other cards.  The other half of the wallet has one zippered pocket (where I keep money) and then slots on either side for receipts, as well as a covered checkbook holder.  All-in-all this one was not as big as my old wallet, and I did have to remove some items before it would close (getting a new wallet is always a good time to clean out all the stuff you don't need anyway!). However, the price was right and the colors offered (I got the lime green) are cute and fashion-forward",

I've had a number of them for years, and they still hold up. I also think they are really comfortable. Also, someone said they are knock off of women's underwear. Jockey made men's Elance bikinis long before they made ANY underwear for women. However, online you can generally only get them in black, grey, and white, which are ok, but not the most fun. You can get a wider variety of colors at department stores. Walmart sells them in a huge variety of colors as the Life brand. \n\nBut a lot better than these are the Hanro Cotton Stretch brief, also for sale on Amazon. They are better made, more comfortable, but extremely pricey. You can buy about 4 packs of these for the price of one of those.",

You then take the other end of the clothesline, along with a small hook (you have to get one separately), and hook it to itself.  \n\nThis can hold a lot of weight - I've had two pairs of wet jeans along with 2 pairs of wet shirts, socks, and underwear all on the line at the same time.  Sure, it'll sag, but it's no problem.\n\nDon't get any of the clotheslines that have suction cups on the end - what if all you have around is wood and concrete?

I wanted two things: Comfort and Stability (to protect my ankles).  I tried out at least 7 different shoes.  The Asics GT-2110 felt the most natural in terms of the amount of \"give\" it had during each step.  Many others had more cushion but they felt too stiff as I launched off my toes. Previously I'd run in the 2100 shoe and (just for the record) I was very willing change brands.  In fact, I was willing to spend a lot more money to protect my knees and ankles.  Turns out it wasn't necessary.\n\nI'm running 5-11 miles per day, both on a tred mill and the road and in both conditions I'm pleased with the shoe.  I have gotten a blister in the same place with both the 2100 and 2110 (just forward of my right arch), so I'm guessing it's my foot, not the shoe.  The 2100 was giving me blisters on my toes, but after going up one size when I bought the 2110's, that was resolved.\n\nAfter a recent bad sprain (don't run in the dark!) I've been using a bulky ankle brace.  Even with the brace, the shoe has been very accomodating.  \n\nI've run in wet conditions a few times and they haven't gotten too soggy, but I've yet to find a shoe that feels \"great\" in the rain.",

They are washable which is another plus because in my opinion too many slippers marketed today are not washable and I will not purchase slippers that I cannot wash.  Even the sizing was appropriately done in my opinion, you should be able to order whatever slipper size you are comfortable with without concern.  The only drawback (and it can be a big drawback) is the plastic cords inserted into the product to keep them together:  one was inserted incorrectly with the result the plastic could not be totally removed.  Because of that I cannot wear the slippers.  The plastic was inserted through the bottom middle of the slipper and after removing the plastic we discovered a portion of it was coming up through the slipper bed and there was no way to remove it.  So, if you're looking for decent slippers these fulfill but the quality control with the plastic inserts might pose a problem.  Frustrating but the product itself is a five-star.",

I was very impressed with the customer service end as that is always important when dealing with a seller or vendor after the initial purchase has been made.  \n\nThe glasses are great.  Though thought of as some as \"80's\" \"Retro\" or what have you, Aviator sunglasses are like Chuck Taylor Converse shoes, like cowboy hats, like your favorite solid color T-shirt.  Its Americana, Classic, and Cool, which is what makes it buck the trend and stand the test of time.  I love my new shades.  They also come in a great hard-case so you can stow them anywhere and not worry about them getting damaged.  Beyond that even, why pay over 100 dollars for a pair of \"name brand\" sunglasses that are made of plastic when you can get something with sturdier, more durable metal frames?  Even beyond that, the UV rating on these is actually not any lower than anything else I've ever worn, solidifying the fact that not only are you getting what you pay for here, but if your not buying here and paying more elsewhere, you are most likely wasting your money.  I was very impressed with the professionalism and kindness showed to me by customer support.  Thanks 80s purple",

I bought it because it conforms to most airline's carry on requirements (It's 41 cubic inches). \nI was worried when the box arrived because it was only 4 inches thick--I thought they sent me the wrong pack because it was so thin; I would find out, however, that this is part of the genius of the design. The bottom of the suitcase is flexible, with the wheels-side acting as a pivot-point. Thus, if you do not need to fully pack the case, it will remain ultra thin. If you pack more, the bottom folds out to accommodate the material. So, if you are only going on a weekend trip, you will have no problem putting this under the seat in front of you. If you pack more, it will easily fit in the overhead bin on the aircraft. The zippers are thick, there are lots of pockets for toiletries (so it's easy to pull them out at security in their little plastic baggie) and documents, and it seems to be coated with plastic to make it waterproof. The wheels are also well-placed and are made of rubber (which makes them quiet and sturdy), but the handle extension bars could be a bit thicker; however, I'm tall, so I appreciate that the handle extends to a comfortable length, which allows me to walk without having the thing bump up against my feet all the time.\nSo, it's a well-designed, nifty little carry on that I'm quite happy with",

Recently I purchased an 8 pack of these briefs for excercising and because I thought I ought to give briefs another try after 6 years. At first, it was a bit strange, but I quickly came to enjoy the feel of this style of underwear. They don't bunch up or give you \"wedgies\" like boxers do because of their looseness and center-seam design. They provide support for your male stuff and stay in place throughout the day. People tend to believe that briefs are \"too tight,\" hence the term tighty whiteys. If they're too tight, you bought them too small. Simple as that. These briefs are perfect for wearing any time in any situation. I thought I might feel self conscious while wearing them, but the comfort of them overshadows any of that. If anything, I'm proud.\n\nOverall, I recommend you give these briefs a shot, no matter what underwear you tend to prefer. However, despite being pre-shrunk they do shrink up a bit after the initial wash. I'm a 32 in boxers, but 34 in these works out great",

I hesitated to order this bra for a long time, as it appears to be pretty ugly in the photo displayed here, but I am pleased to say that in person, it's actually rather pretty.  However, be aware that there are 4 hooks in the back, so forget about your amour quickly unclasping it in during a moment of passion.  These hooks and the stretchy, sheer fabric provide substantial support though, and the wide straps are comfortable and won't leave whiplash marks upon the shoulders.  Unfortunately, the bra is cut rather narrow at the upper sides, heading towards the underarms.  Depending on your build, this can mean that the sides of your breasts will squish out, which is unattractive and indicative of a poor fit, so ordering a larger cup size than normal might be necessary",

She has used them for the beach, around the pool, wearing them to school on non-gym days, going on non-strenuous walks, and so forth. Plus, we have used them as a floating throw toy at motel swimming pools. Even though her shoe size is now 1 to 1-1/2, she still wears them. And, the shoes are in good shape! Also, daughter's mother has been wearing her own pair, for similar uses, for about two years. So, we highly recommend CROCS",

Take it this way, I can donate and not care if anyone else knows, but the people that are the most uptight are usually the ones that go up to people and raise thier banded arm in front of people and go \"i donated, yes i did, and got this cool bracelet, which means i donated\".

In my opinion technology has yet to replace the abilities of natural materials like wool and silk.  Of course, this is only my opinion and preference.  However, when manufactures refuse to inform and the buyer with more than \"Wool and Nylon Blend?\" there is no mechanism to a consumer to make an informed choice or even purchase what they are looking for.\n\nStretch nylon is certainly nice for form fit and ease when it comes to slipping your foot onto your sock and into your boot.  BUT - if too much nylon is present it will show its downside should the hiker or hunter find themselves in a wet situation and hiking for long periods.\n\nIt would seem that the age of the 100% wool sock is almost gone and I accept my fate, but I urge people to NOT buy a sock, which does not disclose the details of its manufacture.\n\nThe review reflects on \"full disclosure in advertising\" and not the product itself.

Period.\n\nI have worn my pair for several years. I wore them daily while walking everywhere I went in Europe. Then I wore them daily while walking miles a day in the advertising business. These shoes have never let me down. The only thing I had to replace was the shoelaces - one time.\n\nI never felt out of place wearing these shoes. Never did I feel that I was too formal in these shoes, nor too casual when meeting clients or attending formal dinners. My so called \"casual\" sneakers got demoted to strictly playing tennis after I bought these shoes.\n\nAs for the comfort, my feet have probably been spoiled because of these shoes. Even if I have to work 16 hour days my feet are still fine. For as much as I've worn these shoes and worked 80 hour weeks in them, the shoes still don't have an odor to them other than that of well worn leather (and it's barely discernable). I've never applied anything to the shoes, save for shoe polish.\n\nI'm having to buy my second pair now because my first pair I've worn out after owning them for almost 5 years. The top of the shoes are fine, only minor abrasions are visible if I don't polish the shoes once in a while. It is the soles that are wearing out, I've worn them down to almost nothing.\n\nI was very lucky to discover Bostonian and I believe I'll never have to hunt for comfortable shoes again that also look great",

Great for djing, but the remnant of the plastic was rather uncomfortable right behind your ear.  So...

        "reviews": "I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  \n\nThe idea of \"Medium\" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.  Is that not \"Medium\" sized? \n\nI think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  \n\nThe draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.\n\nI wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like \"old men's\" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.\n\nI am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.",

No; not just the same brand but the very same two breast pads I brought to the hospital when I gave birth.  These things are the coolest things.  As long as you keep them clean, they will adhere to the breasts and stop leakage just as the description promises.  \n\nFurthermore, these are also great if you are planning on returning to work while pumping/ continuing to nurse.  They are very thin and the profiles are smooth so you won't have to worry about that bulky/ obviously-nursing look which ruins many a beautiful blouse.\n\nAt first I had a little problem getting them absolutely clean but I then I used my body glove to scrub them while I was in the shower and voila!  I have not been tempted to write another review of any other products I have but I just can't believe more women have not discovered the wonder of these things.  \n\nAnother possible drawback is that the pads by nature don't allow for air circulation.  I suggest removing them for as long as you can for a few hours a day so the skin around your nipples can breathe... Removing each pad after a feeding works well for me but you will know what works best for you.  In any case; take a look at the price.  That's all I have spent on pads in 8 months.  What a bargain and an even bigger convenience.  Kudos to the makers of Lily-Padz.  A great shower gift too if you know someone who is expecting to breastfteed",

My feet never get tired or sore from being in them.  Have added some comfort insoles, but that is due to my foot being a 12AA rather than a medium or D width as most men's feet.  Foot never get hot, they stay dry and in winter warm.  \n\nWhen I am not working, my regular shoes seem to not comfort me as well.  Walking a mall or just getting around town in street shoes can make my  back and  legs ache after only a couple hours.  Yet, these Pit Boss boots can let me be on my feet standing/walking for as much as 10hrs straight without feeling sore.\n\nThese have been a blessing climbing or standing on ladders for extended time as the sole is solid enough to give me a good platform to stand on.  The ankle height of them is enough to have saved me  several times from twisting or damaging my ankle.\n\nBeen using this pair for over two years.

These pretty French Knickers were the first of the bunch I tried -- and I absolutely loved `em!\n\nOver the years my hubby has always given me different kinds of lingerie, all of them mainly ethereal or low-cut, but nothing scandalous.  And I think we were both ready for a change.\n\nI immediately fell in love with the high-on-the-hips and almost bottomless look of these knickers - and how they made my legs look even longer!  The fabric was much sheerer than what I was expecting, but the visual effect was pretty close to what's seen in the photo. \n\nThese were the first crotchless panties I'd ever tried.  And it felt different to expose so much of my cheeks in the back (as compared to other boy-cut shorts I had worn).   But it was definitely the feeling of openness in the front - that made me feel the sexiest!  \n\nI wore these to bed one evening along with a matching-color camisole on top.  And even though these knickers made me more accessible (which was wonderful during our warm up), I still removed them (out of habit) when things got more passionate!\n\nFor more general usage, I could easily see myself wearing these under my dress or skirt - when dining out with my husband (as a tease).  But I'd probably want to consider getting a more thorough waxing first!   \n\nTo finish up, I guess I had always thought of crotchless panties as being a little tasteless.  But these cute French Knickers - and the other items I received from Love Fifi - were as beautiful as they made me feel!",

I use it for taking my folding bicycle with me when travelling, and it is big enough that the bike fits in, but small enough that the airlines don't charge a premium for checking it.  It rolls very well on the built-in wheels, and unlike it's smaller cousin the Oyster, this rolls with much more stability due to the wide stance. The only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars are: 1) Sometimes the wide rolling stance is a hassle, e.g. going through narrow gates on a subway or similar, and 2) the built-in locks are not \"TSA\" locks, so in other words, they are useless for air flight.\n\nI would buy this suitcase again",

With its non-colors (black, white, gray) and jock-like look, this is one seriously dull undie. Considering one of the major perks of wearing a thong (compared with lesser styles) is how good it makes you look, this shortcoming is inexcusable. Even my girlfriend concedes that, although better looking than boxers or briefs (neither of which I wear), these are clearly below par for the style. There are plenty of alternatives that are more elegant and stylish. On Amazon alone there's the: Contour Pocket Thong, Extreme Thong, Glossy Thong, Microfiber Contour Thong, Microfiber Low-rise Thong, Skinz Thong and String Thong. Amazon even sells some excellent full backs: Contour Italian Cutaway Bikini, Microfiber Clip Bikini, Silk Extreme Brief and String Tricot Brief. Thongs are clearly the best style but there's nothing wrong with having a bit of variety in your underwear drawer. So in summary: Feel - C, Look - F, Overall - D",

Very comfortable to run in, providing stable footing and extreme cushioning.  They seem to be saving me from some of the normal knee and back pain I get running in my 4 yr old NB's.  Would be great for cross country, because the treads are somewhat knobby. Not too knobby to use on the treadmill so I'd have to say they are a great all around running shoe and are A+ for outdoors/x-country or winter running.  The goretex weather proofing didn't make my feet too hot.  Probably an overkill if you don't plan to use them for running, the knobby tread can make you trip if you're just walking, etc.  I haven't used them in bad weather but I would imagine they would be great for running in rain/snow/ice conditions.  I purchased the size I normally wear and the fit was perfect.  As tradition proves, Adidas are like New Balance in that they are a better fit for a wider foot",

It stops movement while I exercise, even running & jumping, without strapping down my chest.  It has a good shape that I even feel comfortable wearing it under my regular clothes.  I love that it hooks in the back so its easy to get in and out of.  The straps are wide enough that they rest easily on my shoulders and still provide support.  It wicks away sweat.  And they last forever! The only thing I've ever been annoyed with is the metal clasps for adjusting the straps because they fall right on my shoulder blades and sometimes dig into them when I do sit-ups on a harder surface. I definitely suggest this bra for any larger chested women who move around a lot when they exercise",

They look good though, and provide the great arch support New Balance is famous for.\n\nIt's always a good idea to try on shoes before you buy them, but the online price is so seductive, it's difficult to pass up the \"deal\". If possible, try to find some at your local shoe store before you purchase these, as the pictures don't show you all angles of this shoe, and parts of the trim are (in my opinion) \"goofy\" looking.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend these shoes for walking/jogging/going to the gym.

The ear muffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite \"second hand\" feel to it.  It reminded me \n      of opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Store!!!  No Joke.  In fact there were no tags on it at all to \n      inform me of where it was made, what it was made of, washing instructions, etc.  it did not even have the \n      name of the manufacturer!!!!\n\n3.  The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure.  Adjusting the width was \n      nerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it!\n\n4.  The \"wool\"(?) had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it.  Furthermore it was sparse and flat.... NOT warm and fuzzy.  I  \n      doubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue.  Besides, there was no tag to indicate that\n      it wasnt in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester.\n\n5.  I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely, so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my ears  \n     warm at all.\n\nIN CONCLUSION,  this product is NOT NEW, NOT SOFT, NOT WARM, NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN!!!\n\nWhat more can I say?

I had seen the Aimee gown before, and I really liked the looks of it, and the reviews seemed great.\n\nAfter purchasing the gown (was shipped via Fed Ex to Canada, which means I got dinged by Fedex's \"customs broker\" costs...) I tried it on while 8 months pregnant to see how it fits.\n\nI purchased a size XL as I am around a sz 14 pre-pregnancy.  I have a normal bust size of 36D.\n\nThe gown itself is made of a nice heavyweight cotton with lots of stretch and recovery (doesn't just stretch out and stay there), the crossover top is really nice becuase it crosses over and will be easy to pull aside for nursing, but the v isn't too deep  (nobody needs to see *that* much of my clavicle).  There is a slit up the side for ease of walking, but it's a very high slit, too high, I felt. \n\nThe gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but I don't fault them for that, it's not advertised as fitting during pregnancy.  However, after giving birth, I still don't think it would fit well for the first couple of weeks, until the baby belly subsides a bit.  The gown stretches well enough to fit over a slowly-declining bump, but unfortunately, as you walk around, the elastic contracts the gown back up over your bump, pulling the slit on the side higher and higher up your leg.  The gown itself is long enough to more than cover your bump as it retracts, but it's not a comfortable feeling when that slit creeps higher and higher.\n\nThe bustline will be great when I'm nursing - easy to pull over, and great coverage on the other side.  It fits well under the bust (elasticised under the cups) but I found the cups were HUGE on my breasts.  It fit well at the band, but I guess they figure if you're a big girl, you must have big boobs.  Luckily, I'm handy at sewing, so I plan to take the gown up at the shoulders to fix this.\n\nOverall, I think this will be a great gown to wear around the house while breastfeeding.... after the baby belly has subsided.  I do plan to bring it to the hospital with me, but only after I've taken in the seams at the shoudlers, and closed the side slit a bit",

As a breastfeeding counselor, I always suggest to moms that they look for something without underwire (can cause plugged ducts for some moms, esp. in the beginning).  This bra gives the support without sacrificing shape or comfort.  Some comfy nursing bras (Bravado and sleep bras) give you a \"uniboob\" look-not flattering under close-fitting shirts.  This one looks awesome on.  This bra is also very forgiving of size changes, as the cups are stretchy to allow for growth (and, later, shrinking).  To find the best fit, go to a boutique and let them size you.  Then order the right size online.  [...",

I love the fact that it comes with containers for my toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, soap) and also with a comb, brush, and mirror.

Looked at some very pricey options at local stores and couldn't find anything with the style I was looking for.  \n\nTook the risk and bought this over the internet (for significantly less $ than the others I was considering) and I am extremely happy with it.  \n\nThe case, even when full is not bulky, but stores a surprising amount.  There are open slots that hold both my notebook and my organizer, a zippered section for my files, two flat zippered sections for miscelanious papers, two 1/2 size pockets for holding my camera and a newspaper perfectly, slots for business cards and a pen organizer.  \n\nQuality is great, thick leather, nice stitching.  My only minor complaint is the latches are magnetic.  I prefer the physical catch type as they are a little easier to latch without looking. \n\nI actually took some brown shoe polish to it right away to give it more of an aged patina and love it.  I also cut off the stupid cell-phone holder because I thought it was ugly, bulky, and I would never use it even if my phone fit.  \n\nOverall I'm extremely happy with both the David King bag and Luggagepoint's service.

I think the price is what has kept me from buying them and have always gotten sandals without reguard to who makes them as long as they were in the $20 range.  \n\nAfter my last pair fell apart I decided to spend the extra money for Birkenstocks.  I am glad I did.  You can tell how well made they are right out of the box.  They are extremely comfortable to wear, and the footbed is firm but soft.  The longer you wear them the more comfortable they get.  I like the birkibuc material better than leather as it seems to be more water resistant.  The arch is solid and in just the right spot for proper support.  The part where the strap is attached to the sole is seamless and very well done.  \n\nI am very happy about purchasing the sandals and I recommend them highly.  Your feet won't hurt wearing them all day like some sandals or flip flops.  One thing to watch out for, it says the size measures true but the first pair I ordered were much too big and I had to send them back for a smaller pair.  I used the conversion chart the seller has, but you may want to order a half or full size smaller than you normally would.

My foot also seems to pronate markedly. The left boot doesn't seem to suffer from the same defect. They also have very \"hard\" cushioning...I can't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots.\n\nAlso I've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets.\n\nI should probably return them as defective, but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive",

It doesn't have vents or pockets or anything but manages to keep the rain out and not get super condensed on the inside with sweat. It's the one rain jacket I took with me on my 2500 mile Canada to Mexico ride along the Great Divide. The first day it poured and this jacket did great. It's never leaked and I've used it a ton in rides around my home turf of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nAfter 10 months of pretty hard use the jacket did develop some little tears and if you aren't careful you can rip the material. So for a day-in, day out jacket you might want something stronger and pricier like a Burley or a Showers Pass jacket (or Rainshield's pricer nylon O2 jacket) but at $35 this jacket does better than a lot of jackets costing 4 or 5 times as much.

We used to go backpacking a lot in our childless days and I would not say this carrier is quite as comfortable as the pack I used for that (a Gregory) *but* then again my Gregory pack has always just ridden quietly on my back and doesn't throw its weight around and yell in my ear.  I think the wiggle of the cargo accounts for the difference in comfort, and the difference is not that big.  Still, I have never hiked more than 6 miles with my kid in this and I can't imagine going much further than that.  I'm willing to admit this is due more to my going soft than poor pack design, though.\n\nWe can fit all his diaper supplies in the attached backpack if we use disposables, tie a few toys off the loops on the carrier, and stuff a sippie cup in the holder in back, and it makes for a nicely contained baby unit for a day hike.\n\nWhat I have found this pack to be unexpectedly great for is to use in place of a stroller where strollers are a hinderence - such as historical sites - or for walking around the mall or grocery store.  My kid has reached this point where he hates to ride in the shopping cart and tries to climb out, but for some reason he is happy as a clam riding up high on my back in this pack.  Generally happier than when in the stroller, even.  Never fights to get down.\n\nMy husband and I can both use this pack comfortably.  I am about 5'4 and use the pack on the second from the smallest setting; he is 5'10 and uses it maybe 2 settings bigger.  I think there are about 8 settings in all so this could certainly work well for a wide range of people.\n\nFrom a kid perspective, my boy is about 30 pounds, 35 or 36 inches, and he's riding with the seat in the middle (of 3) adjustment.  \n\nThe only thing I don't like about it is the sunshade/rainhood, which is included with this model but makes this model more expensive than the next model down, which I think is called the Journey.  We just never use it because it wigs my kid out so we should have saved the money.\n\nI also looked at REI's child carriers, Baby Trend, and a lower priced Kelty (Base Camp, I think?) and the suspension just didn't compare.  The Pathfinder line is just much, much more comfortable.  I don't even understand why Kelty puts out carriers like the Base Camp.\n\nMy only regret is not having gotten a frame carrier sooner.  I overestimated at which point he'd be ready for one",

I tried the \"Medela Seamless Underwire Full Fit Nursing Bra\" in a 34G and 34H. This one is the most supportive, but is an underwire (which after 8 hours, I can't wait to take off - and I've always been a committed underwire wearer) and the H cup fits, but I'm nervous about if it will fit once my milk REALLy comes in. I also tried the \"Fancee Free Foam Support Soft Cup Nursing Bra,\" which I also got in a 34G and 34H is not the most supportive, but is comfortable (i wear this one to bed, around the house, etc.).\n\nSo, regarding the Goddess bra - I just got a 34G and yes, the cups are a little big, which I'm so thankful for because that will certainly allow for some growth and they aren't so big that my breasts look silly through shirts. Not to mention, the cup part that is looser is mostly around the nipple (I've been instructed to begin wearing a nipple shield, so it allows for room for that so-not-inconspicuous item to be). My favorite part is the back portion, which is a stretchy cotton and does not dig into my ribs by the end of the day like the others. It is also pretty supportive, maybe a 9 out of 10 in supportiveness compared to the Medela - but steps above the Fancee Free. I will likely buy one more G and an H in this style - and call it a day on buying nursing bras because I finally found what I'm looking for. I'd recommend buying one that is a cup size below what you normally wear if you're looking to wear it right now and you may have to wear a size up after milk comes in.\n\nThis bra really got me excited - enough that after 4 years of ordering from Amazon, this is the first review I was ever compelled to write.

These undershirts are made of extremely soft cotton that is just slightly thinner than your average undershirt from Hanes or the likes.

I don't know what is different about them, but unlike cheaper tee's, they come to fit you perfectly rather than just hanging flat down your sides like so many other undershirts.\n\nIf you haven't worn these before, you don't know what you're missing out on. The comfortable fit means your underarms don't sweat at all because the material fits you perfectly rather than gaping open under your arms. I really can't describe what a difference these shirts make to my day-to-day comfort.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that they are slightly hard to come by -- so once you're hooked you'll always want to have a few extras on hand.

        "reviews": "I purchased the Boston Clog in the summer of 2000, have worn it every year since then, and am happy to report that it is still the most comfortable shoe I possess.  Since many of the other reviews here have praised its comfort, I will briefly pass over a few of the problems that will probably occur over long-term wear.\n\nFirst, after about a year of wear, the outsole began to detach itself from the rest of the clog.  This was easily fixed with some shoe glue that I purchased at a shoe store.  Since applying it in 2001 or so, I have not had any further problems with the outsole coming off.\n\nSecond, as mentioned in one review, the part of the outsole where your foot hits the ground most often will wear out fastest. This is to be expected.  Nevertheless, after close to seven year's worth of wear, the outsole is still holding up quite well, the heel being the only place where there is no grip pattern left.  Still, plenty of outsole remains.\n\nFinally, about a year ago the leather lining of the footbed started to detach itself from the cork underneath the heel.  Again, any good adhesive will solve the problem.  This time I used super glue--problem solved.  \n\nOverall, the leather reflects seven year's worth of use, but it is still holding up very well, both on the footbed, and on the entire upper part.  All things considered, I have worn a lot of shoes in the past seven years, many of them overpriced European brands fabled for comfort (Ecco, Camper, Clarks) but the Boston Clog has outlasted all of them in terms of durability and comfort.  I highly recommend this quality shoe",

I love the navy and the white colors. I put mine in my wish list for my birthday or mothers' day.\n here is how you measure. put you foot ( if even doesn't matter wich foot, if uneven use the loner foot to determine your size). take a 11x12 paper and make two marks one at the heel and one at the big toe then look at the chart put your finger on the inches (foot measurement) and run across  to see your size. remember these sandals only run in whole sizes, so if your half go up one. also know your width\n\nWomen:\nSize  Inches   CM \n4      8 \u00bc     21 \n4 \u00bd    8 \u00bd     21.6 \n5      8 5/8   21.9 \n5 \u00bd    8 \u00be     22.2 \n6      9       22.9 \n6 \u00bd    9 1/8   23.2 \n7      9 \u00bc     23.5 \n7 \u00bd    9 \u00bd     24.1 \n8      9 5/8   24.4 \n8 \u00bd    9 \u00be     24.8 \n9      10      25.4 \n9 \u00bd    10 1/8  25.7 \n10     10 \u00bc    26 \n10\u00bd    10 \u00bd    26.7 \n11     10 5/8  27 \n12     11      27.9 \n13     11 \u00bc    28.6 \n\nI hope this helps you to determine your size.

Hardly worth the $14.99 GemAvenue (e4hats) charged me for it. $0.99 would have been a fair deal. 2. The ear muffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite 'second hand' feel to it. It reminded me of opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Store!!! No Joke. In fact there were no tags on it at all to inform me of where it was made, what it was made of, washing instructions, etc. it did not even have the name of the manufacturer!!!! 3. The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure. Adjusting the width was nerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it! 4. The 'wool'(?) had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it. Furthermore it was sparse and flat.... NOT warm and fuzzy. I doubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue. Besides, there was no tag to indicate that it wasn't in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester. 5. I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely, so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my ears warm at all. IN CONCLUSION, this product is NOT NEW, NOT SOFT, NOT WARM, NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN!!! What more can I say? I am just disgusted at Gem Avenue (e4hats) for selling me this rip off useless piece of JUNK!!! I will NEVER buy anything from Gem Avenue (e4hats) EVER again!!",

You use the click wheel and the slide on top through the silicon.\n\nIt also looks pretty good.\n\nThe only thing that takes some getting used to is the silicon over the click wheel.  It, like the click wheel was when I first got the iPod, takes some getting used to.  It's pretty thin and tends to buckle if you push hard.  (Don't worry, though.  It fixes itself when you pick up your finger.)\n\nIf you're looking for a good quality, semi cool looking, funcional cover, this is a pretty good choice.\n\nEither way, enjoy and share your music whenever you can!!",

I don't know if my shoes were missing that part or what, but I found the sole to be hard and inflexible.  They were still _comfortable_ but it wasn't like putting your feet on pillows or anything.\n\nIf you do prefer a squishier footbed, I recommend a thin insert, so as not to squish your toes.

The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the \"Aluminum\" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done.\n\nSincerly\nRo",

I also needed something that wasn't so thick it would cause me to sit off-center and create back pain. This wallet performed as expected, took care of both problems, and looks good! The only two downsides are that it's a little too tall for standard depth pants pockets. This just means that I have to be a little more watchful that it doesn't fall out or get stolen ... but keeping an eye on my wallet is always a smart idea! The only other problem is that dollar bills are not easily moved into our out from the side pockets. It's as if the pocket is the exact same length as the dollar bills themselves, which makes quickly stowing and retrieving money a little cumbersome. My solution was to just lay the money over the cards and close the wallet on it. It now makes access to my money even easier, and I have had no problem with anything falling out.

It is definitely big enough for the average man's toiletries.\n\nI like it. It also doesn't have a lot of inside pockets. There is just one wallet-sized pouch inside which doesn't have its own zipper. Not a mesh. I'm not sure what it's big enough for - floss and lip balm? The rest of the inside is open and free. It has a water-proof lining and a wire with flaps to open the compartment wide (essential in a toiletries bag really). Well-crafted from what I can tell.\n\nThe outside is a very handsome patterned leather. It looks aged without looking worn. It also smells of leather out of the box - so much nicer than the faux-leather travel kits. You won't mind having your clothes rub against it in your luggage.\n\nI have a slight quibble with the handle - it is not as easy to grab as in most kits.

I agree with my wife when she said, \"This place uses good quality silk materials and has a great prices!!\"  When we got the scarf today 4/10/07 (ordered 4/4/07) and opened it to see what the silk scarf looked like in person .. my wife wished that she had ordered one for herself, one for my mother and one more for our sister in-law.

I normally wear a 6.5 shoe, and these felt a little big when I first tried them on. However, when I tried on a size 6 shoe, I knew that was too small. I ended up buying the 6.5. I just wasn't used to having a shoe that fits AND allows me enough toe room to wiggle my toes. Merrells are great for people who need a little more room in the toebox, but who don't have feet wide enough to move to a wider shoe. These shoes are not waterproof, so you will need to treat them if you plan on hiking through wet weather. I recommend the purchase of insoles after you have worn these shoes for a few months. The insole they come with is rather thin and doesn't offer a whole lot of support. Overall, if given the choice, I would happily buy these shoes again. I would also say they run true to size for most people.",

It makes him more comfortable when he wears them outside to get the mail, the paper, etc. because he doesn't have to worry about the side of the slipper getting wet by dew on the grass or the small puddles left by the sprinklers.\n\nThey appear to be very well made and durable, he hasn't had them long enough to know if they really are but they seem to be.  We live in Florida so it is difficult to find slippers that can be worn year round and the flannel lining in these keeps your feet warm in cool weather and not too hot in warm weather.  \n\nOne thing about these though is we had to return the first pair because they were a little snug on his feet.  According to him, because of the rubber sole wrapping up along the side prevented them from giving so they were a little tight.  We had to go a size larger than he usually wears.

There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying 'Made in China' and that's it. The tag even recommends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact.

A half size up did the trick, however.\n\nI love that it comes in patent leather because it really adds a kick to your feet.

I guess this isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just didn't look like that at all in the picture. Also, the strap that goes across the top of the foot is very low, and if you have wide feet, it could make your feet look even wider (or fatter). \n\nDespite those two small flaws, I really like this shoe and find that I can wear it with almost anything (they look especially cute with skirts)",

Obviously, they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches. The idea of 'Medium' as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards. My body fat is low. I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32'' waist. Is that not 'Medium' sized? I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waistband altogether. One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems. The drawstring is fine. It allows flexibility. So what if your pants fall down? It seems to be the fashion, anyway. Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waistband that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions. Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing. They looked like crap after the first time I washed them. I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again. My life partner told me they looked like 'old men's' underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

        "reviews": "Adidas has three types of shoes for their \"Ride\" shock absorption running shoes; the Gigaride, Megaride, and this - the Microride. Microride outsole consists of smaller sized absorption grooves (aka Nike Shox lookalike). Gigarides and Megarides emphasize shock absorption. Microride is more concerned with weight, it seems like.\n\nThere are also two models of Microride, one with full fabric top, another with synthetic leather construction. This one is the full fabric, which is supposed to be soft, and also lighter. (The synthetic leather is supposed to be more durable.)\n\nAnyway, with the combination of Microride and full mesh top, this shoe is low and very light. I can't find a number anywhere, but once started running, the shoes feel like featherweight. The impact is a little bit harder, due to less shock absorption, so it's probably more of a treadmill shoe than trails. Overall, though, very comfortable. It's my first time with running shoes this light and I like it. With these, I achieved my fastest pace ever with less effort than I would have expected.\n\nA couple of things I did notice: the size is on the narrow/small side (compared to my Nikes), and the back heel support is a bit hard/tall for my liking. The white version gets dirty quickly. Running was good, but walking on wet road experienced slight slippage. Also, the workmanship leaves a bit to be desired",

This bra has hiked my bosom up and kept it up all day.  I have not experienced any sagging or shifting of the garment.\n\nAs I mentioned the support is excellent, it has even passed the \"jiggle test\".  If I have to hurry somewhere or, heaven forbid, break into a jog \"the girls\" stay where they ought offering no threat of injury to me or any innocent passer-by.  The side supports are, no doubt part of the reason for the bra's effectiveness but they can pinch a bit.  In short, it feels GOOD to take the bra off at the end of the day.  I do not however fantasize about slipping out of it at lunchtime to ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain as I have with some others.\n\nA bra is, quite naturally, a very personal garment and therefore difficult to recommend but I do recommend this bra for large-busted women.

A very well-designed and beautiful shoe but you pay big bucks for it",

I wish there was a bit more padding on the inside and that the corner didn't press on the L and R buttons as much, but that's not too big of a deal.  You can fit two 3-game slim cases in the top pouch and still close the case.  Three is too snug.  There is no place for the charger, so you'll have to carry that elsewhere.  All around, a well-made case for a reasonable price",

I freaked out thinking they had discontinued them because I thought they were made of Gore Windstopper and couldn't find any that said \"made with Gore Windstopper\" but actually it's Polarguard Windbloc.  In any case, when you freak out becuase you think you might not be able to get something again you realize just how much you like that thing. \n\nThese are totally windproof.  Extremely compact, I don't think you can make them any thinner than this.  Good price.  \n\nThe only \"downside\" is that they take a long time to dry out when they get wet.  This is true of any windproof glove so it's really not fair to call it a down side of this particular glove.  These weigh nothing (probably about an ounce each) and so I pack two or three pairs if I know I'll be getting them wet. \n\nI wear these ice climbing, hiking, mountaineering, I have a pair I cut the finger tips off of for rock climbing in winter, and I wear them skiing inside of my mittens. \n\nThese really shine inside of mittens because if you have to do anything with your hands the mitten must come off and these completely protect your hands from the wind during that time.  I haven't had cold hands skiing for two seasons now, a problem that plagued me for years. \n\nI can't recommend these enough.  \n\n-Scott",

I received a response from TV Guys the very next day, asking for a phone number where I could be reached so that the problem could be resolved. I emailed them my number and received a call the following day. The gentleman I spoke with was very apologetic, explained that he had no idea how this could have happened, and asked what he could do to fix the situation. I asked for a full refund and he was more than willing to refund my entire purchase as well as the shipping charges I had incurred. Because of the promptness and professionalism with which this incident was handled, I will order from them again in the future",

If they don't fit you have to go to the trouble of returning them to the vendor, and I, for one, really don't want to be bothered doing that.  I also hate buying shoes in a store and dealing with no customer service, crowds, and a limited shoe selection.  I do research before buying shoes from the Internet and really examine the size I'm getting before the purchase.\n\nThese Sauconys fit me very well.  The size is true; I ordered size 8.5 wide and that's what they are.  I have them on now, and they give me very good support.  They are lightweight and give me the support in the ankles that I need because I stand at work all day.  My ankles can really feel sore by the end of my shift without the proper shoes.  Also, the toebox is tapered but there is plenty of space for my toes.  The shoes provide enough room without looking clunky.\n\nI just hope I will be able to buy the exact same shoe when the time comes to replace them.  Why do shoe companies insist on discontinuing a perfectly good style?  This makes it so much harder to purchase shoes on the Internet",

It features a smooth, full grain, blemishless, fully lined, leather upper, and a flexible leather sole with rubberized contact patches*. There is not much more that an Allen Edmonds, costing hundreds of dollars more, will get you.\n\nI got one in size 15M, which is my normal shoe size. Size 15M in this shoe is relatively tight-fitting at the arch, in comparison to my Florsheim 15M oxfords (two different models). So, the gentleman that remarked in earlier comments about the size being a tad smaller is correct. If I had known, I would have gotten a half-size bigger. However, that would have added unnecessary shoe length when all I needed was a quarter inch of additional coverage at the arch. I wish shoe makers had an arch fitment scale like they have with the width of the foot, i.e., medium, wide, extra wide, etc.\n\n* an earlier commenter mentioned that the rubberized outer lining on the sole started to come unglued after only a few months of wear; I cannot comment on this aspect yet as I have had these for only a few weeks yet, and have worn them only three or four time to date. I will update this review if I discover that I have this problem also",

After wearing the M1122 shoe for only a few months, my pair started producing a very strong odor. The smell was not from the inside but from the outer backside, specifically the area consisting of the ENCAP material which, according to New Balance, is a polyurethane plastic. The smell gradually got worse, so bad in fact, I had to keep them in my garage with the smell being like a mildew/urine odor. I don't own pets, nor had I gotten anything sprayed on it. The smell didn't suddenly occur either, it gradually became more intense over a few weeks. Washing the shoes in the washer wouldn't get the smell out so I returned them to a New Balance store in late December 2006, and they replaced it with a new pair. Up until this past week (late March 2007), the new pair has been great, but now they have started putting off the very same odor, again, not inside the shoe, but coming from the areas on the shoe that the ENCAP material is featured. I decided to call New Balance directly and informed them of the problem. They told me that they did in fact have other complaints from people all commenting of an odd odor coming from the M1122 model shoe. NB requested the pair be sent to them for testing. If you have experienced this problem with your M1122 (or other models), contact New Balance customer support via their website. \n\n** With regards to comfort I give this shoe a five star, but with regards to the problem above, I would have to give it a zero star.

Next to the pen holder is a small zippered pocket, which runs deep behind the pen and cell phone pockets -ample space for a notepad. The front main zippered compartment holds a small zippered pocket inside that is great for cash and cards. The shoulder strap is removable, and there are straps on the back for looping through a belt or whatnot. I never found it necessary, but you may find it useful.\n\nWhile it wasn't quite what I was hoping for, it is a good bag all-in-all.\n\nOh, and fair warning -the bag absolutely stank when it arrived.

The Bose are superior if you want to listen to music in a better quality system (I own a Harman Kardon equipment and Bose speakers), but all in all I consider the noisebusters of better value for what I paid and very very close to the Bose on reducing the external noise.\n \nIn net, I am definitively purchasing a new Noisebuster pair to replace my first set which is already showing signs of aging and would recommend the NB to anybody",

As a long time 505 guy, I thought their must be a lower line of jeans of Levi's that they are releasing to big chain stores, saving their Regular Levi Name for Department stores.  Well, finally I broke down to look at a pair of these jeans when I say they were on sale. I was astonished, they are exactly the same jean, for an average of $10 less.  Look closely, the stitching is the same, even the position of the inside labels. The buttons and rivits are the same as well.  The main difference is that the Back Pockets don't have that little red Levi tag, and the \"V\" shaped decorative detail stich. Otherwise these are the same jeans. They fit just as well, and I think even better, but that may be because my wallet is a bit fuller fit after buying these. After 15 years of 505's, I have found a new favorite.  Seriously, check these out, you wont be dissapointed.  Even better, they do have a kids line, so for your growing kids you can get the same levi quality for less, nice when they grow out of jeans so fast.  If you are worried about where they are manufactured, I can tell you the last 20 pairs of Levi's I have had have been made in either mexico, Columbia, or somewhere in asia, so these being made in egypt is not a big deal, at least they grow cotton their.\nNote: button fly 501 people, they do not have a line of Signature button flys, so you have to stick to regular levi's.

I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.\n\nAfter asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.\n\nWith the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this.

The suede is smooth and pliable and the shearling is not too fluffy inside but definitely enough to keep your hands warm and it feels so nice to put your hands in these.  I had a problem figuring out size so if it is any help, my husband tried them on and he is 5'9 and wears a size large in clothing.  I would say his hands are medium in size, a bit wide but average length of fingers and the medium glove fit perfectly.  I hope that helps someone who is having trouble deciding on size, for me that was the hard part. The gloves came tagged with an Amazon hang tag listing the regular price as $79.99 so I am not sure where the price they show comes from but still a great deal.

You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself.\n\nSo, for the cheaper price Walmart offers, I feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there.

I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. \nCons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say \"Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains\". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest.\nSpecifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.\nAfter considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.\nSo, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. \n I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6\" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon.

I used to be real careful with them, and brush them off whenever they got soiled, but I stopped doing that for the last year or so.  I trek through dirt, mud, sand, gravel, and miles upon miles of pavement, and these little buggers show almost no treadwear.  The only restorative effort I've made is to replace the laces.  I can see these things lasting at least another year or so, but I'm tempted to simply retire them now, just because I like buying new sneakers.

I have only two minor complaints about this product.

I can get away with wearing this without a bra only  when I am looking for the \"tied down\" look, but maybe that's because I normally wear a D cup.  But I wasn't really looking for a bra substitute.  I bought this looking for (and expecting) a control garment to handle the bumps and rolls that ruin the look when I wear a fine gauge swaeter or twinset.  Not too much to ask, and it would have done the job -- except it rides up something fierce.   I immediately thought this was because the garment ran small, so I bought one a size larger --no luck.  The only way to stop this annoying feature of the undergarment is to tuck it into the waist of a snug fitting skirt or pair of pants, and then not to sit down.  Not so much fun.  Oh well, back to the drawing board",

They slip on easily, with no need for a shoe horn, and they stay on securely, without coming loose at the heel, as some loafers are prone to do.  \n\nThis is my first pair of Clarks and I'm very impressed so far with the high quality of the leather, the comfort, and the look.  \n\nAll in all, these shoes are great.

Even though I (finally and after a lot of cussing) got the straps around my bra, the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. \n\nThen there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there. It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. \n\nThe directions say to attach the Spanx/straps to the bra and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Much easier said than done.\n\nFor it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. So altogether I have spent about $150 for Spanx stuff I can't use.\n\nThere must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.\n\nNot happy",

If you have smaller feet I'd try to get a different size than M/L.  They do ride a bit higher on the foot than some of the others -- they are fine with loafers, but a lower cut shoe could be problematic.\n\nI've tried a lot of these socks:  Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan, Peds, Leggs, et al.

It works but you would really rather be wearing a jacket that can be zipped and unzipped.\n\nA decent cycling jacket costs about $150 more or less, but if you're a novice you don't need to blow that kind of cash, and this jacket will serve you fine.  Keep it with you just in case, and see the envy on others faces as they shiver in their lycra or suffer the sauna conditions of wearing a garbage bag to keep dry because they didn't carry this handy bit that easily fits in a jersey pocket or any kind of backpack without too much bulk.\n\nKeeping the wind out alone is a big way to keep warm in foul conditions, while continuous riding will produce more than enough heat to keep you warm most of the time.\n\nIf you're heading out for, say, NYC's Five Borough Bike Tour in May, and don't know what to buy, your basics are: some kind of jersey--a CoolMax shirt will do; 6 panel or more cycling shorts with a chamois (pad) where the sun don't shine; light / thin socks (Air-e-ators are best); and one of these jackets.  These and a helmet and you're set for serious riding.\n\nSkip the bulky layers for warmth.  If you want that bit of insulation you may need, get a $10 polarfleece vest from a bargain store, and one of these jackets. \n\nI take one star because it doesn't have vented armpits, but on second thought I probably shouldn't have in consideration of the price to value ratio",

I've probably only read three reviews in all the time I've been shopping on Amazon.  I don't remember why I started to read these reviews but once I did I was hooked.\nI am 52 years old, fat but not a stupid moron.  I've lost 4 people that I love to cancer.  I am a cancer surviver.  I think these bracelets are exactly what they are supposed to be, funny.\nI believe they are a personal statement, as is every other colored band that is sold.  What I think is wierd is the uproar this has caused on both sides.\nThe truly offensive people are those who feel they can judge a person by any bracelet, hat or car.  While I drive my SUV I wear no bracelets of any color.  I have taken the advice of D.L. Hereford and D. Ray \"conspiracy theory\" and send my chairitable contributions direct.  I contribute time as well as money to what I believe in and time slipping a bracelet on and off doesn't count.\nI have a daughter-in-law who does relay walks and other fund raising activities while she wears her yellow bracelet.  I think she considers the bracelet less important than the rest.  I think Silent Bob would approve.\nBrent Freakin' Wilson, your anger over this is way overboard.  I sense other personal issues.  See your pastor.\nThe emperor of ice cream needs to write a book, maybe he could call it, I'M SMART, SEE.  Or perhaps a Geraldo type talk-show would work better.  Then he could allow people to view his impressive intelligence first hand.\nLovestory 27, quite reading romances and grow up.  By the way, there are t-shirts that have money going to charitible causes, too.  Why allow the evil doers to put live wrong on a shirt? \nDoesn't anyone realize this is Amazon.com not a political forum?  All the bands, black, yellow, pink or aquamarine are more club membership cards than anything else, don't make them more important than they are.

I find it hard to find jeans that fit me right because I have a small, well-defined waist but more generous hips, buttocks, and thighs; most jeans that fit my lower half have a large gap at the back of the waist.  When I tried these jeans on in my usual size, 8, they were a bit too tight, but when I went up to a size 10, they fit quite well.  There is a *slight* gap at the back of the waist when I wear this jeans, but because the fabric has a hint of spandex, they fit my body well enough to wear without a bit.  The spandex also makes these jeans extremely comfortable; they hug my body nicely without feeling the least bit tight.  I also love the low rise, which falls an inch or two below my belly button, just where I like it, and the boot cut, which gives my short legs a wonderfully long, lean look.  I'm just shy of 5'5\", and the 32\" inseam is a bit long on me, but I prefer my jeans on the longer side these days, so the length seems just right.

When I got my Bella Bands, I automatically felt better about myself! So far, they have four fabulous functions that have been a life-saver:\n1. Make shorter, non-maternity shirts appear longer so you can wear them for longer\n2. Allow you to wear non-maternity pants with the button undone - even jeans!\n3. Hold the bands of maternity pants up so you can wear those earlier.\n4. Keep everything tucked in a supported so you feel more confident and less flabby.\nSo far, I'm wearing them tucked over once, but I'm sure later in my pregnancy I will expand them to full size and they'll be an added comfort and peace of mind.

        "reviews": "Theoretically speaking, this seems to be a handy little doo-dad/gizmo/thingamabob for the well-organized/obsessive-compulsive traveler, but please take note of the following pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n1. It gives you a fairly accurate preview of the weight of your luggage (+/- a few ounces) saving you the irritation of arriving at the airline counter with over-heavy luggage, and having to repack and shuffle potentially embarrassing items around in full view of the other passengers.\n\n2. You can use the tape measure to verify that your carry-on luggage will fit in the overhead compartment, or under the seat.  This saves you from participating in the dreaded and ruthless shoving tournament of the skies, where people try to stuff bags the size of newborn elephants into the overhead lockers.\n\nCons:\n\n1. It has the capacity to weigh suitcases up to 75 lbs, but when you're traveling alone, it's very awkward to lift a suitcase even half that weight with your arms extended (so that it doesn't touch your body) and still read the tiny numbers on the dial. \n\n2. The handle is small and \"ergonometrically-challenged\", and people who can't lift a 50 lb suitcase with one outstretched hand will find it very difficult to get two hands in there.  Even if you do manage to get this far, you won't be able to hold it for long before the handle sinks deep into your palm, cutting you a new lifeline.\n\n3. You need to try to balance the suitcase by centering the hook on the suitcase handle, but if you lift too quickly, the hook slips to one side, causing possible grievous bodily harm as the suitcase comes down on your toe.\n\n4. Another hook problem - you can see that the hook is an open design. If you are lifting the suitcase, the hook can slip off on the way up, causing the suitcase to fall as in 3. above. Even worse, the momentum keeps your hand moving upwards, and not only can you give yourself a shiner or broken nose with the back of your hand, but the hook can swing up and jab you in the eye. (True story)\n\n\nYou can use it on lighter luggage without too many problems, but then again, if your luggage is light you have no need to fear the scale - do you?  On the surface this sounds like a great travel gadget, but beware of the pitfalls.\n\n\nAmanda Richards, September 22, 200",

I ordered it in body beige, which is plenty light, and does not show through my white dress.  It was a little hard to put on, but that's to be expected with the firm control stuff, also, the bra part didn't want to stay up very well.  I felt like I had to keep tugging it up, but it just felt saggy, it didn't look saggy.  This may be because the back of the unitart is a pretty low V shape to accomadate most back styles of dresses.  I think adding velcro to the bra and the inside of my dress will solve this problem.  Also, the two pieces of boning on the sides poke my waist in rather unnaturally.  Alone it looks kind of funny, but with the dress on you can't tell.  There is a gussett in the crotch to allow for trips to the restroom but I'm not sure how well this will work, as I have not tried it yet.  I'm hoping I won't have to...\n\nOverall the quality is very good for the money and it does a very nice job of shaping and smoothing without showing under a white dress",

A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice. \n\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :) \n\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk. \n\nThis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not \"cling\" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor. \n\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design. \n\nMay I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier! \n\nI cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection",

It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. \n\nIf you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. \n\nFor those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. \n\nClearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants. \n\nI found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. \n\nPractical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of \"expansion room\". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. \n\nIf you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C? It is the same price (at review time) and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines. I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page",

They come in so many colors and each year, another one or two is added to the line. I wore these touring around Europe and Japan earlier this year--walking around all day, every day for over a week in each place--because they're much more comfortable than my Nikes etc., that cost five times as much. They go great with everything, and don't try to tell me different! A great investment at $22",

The concept is good, but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger. That might solve the length discomfort, but there still isn't sufficient heighth comfort. They felt like an all encompassing vise, squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief. Very uncomfortable.",

        "reviews": "I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer). They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants). Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order. Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic. LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned. Among the changes: The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches. It now rolls! Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches! It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight. The waist just hung..... Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down. When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up. I had to pin the waist to keep them on... That's not all the changes..... They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches! No more slightly tapered leg. The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5. If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers..... The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size? I think not. They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz). The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones. Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length. It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after. The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches. Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs. Do you get the picture? The waist sags and rolls. The seat is major baggy. My belly button shows. They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch. They are sucked tight to my thighs, then balloon out from my knees to the feet. They're too long, so you can't even see my feet. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a 'specialist' at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes. That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs. Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical. IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN. THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE 'OLD' VERSION. SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO 'FIX' THEM???",

While much negative commentary concerning Levi Strauss's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s, the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970's standby, the 505, which has a zipper as opposed to button fly. The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order. The 501 are easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist, which is the so-called \"anti-fit\" waist, meaning there is no curve to the rise (the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist), because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang, rather than be fitted to the waist. The biggest problem I have noted on the 505's is the variability in size in the thigh area, meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight, even though they are theoretically the same size of a label. The 501s are pretty safe as far as sizing.",

On the positive side:  the weight of the fabric is good for exercising, especially for the gym, and it would be a good single layer for outside/warm temperatures.   The fit is pretty good (I am average sized and wear sizes 8-10); I don't like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn't look like I'm wearing a bag.  On the negative side: I am a little short-waisted, and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips, which I don't like but accept.  Also, the vee-neck is not a very strong vee (pictures of this shirt are true in that respect).  A lot of technical tees are like this -- designed more for function than for style maybe -- and vee-necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid.  I prefer a true vee-neck.  Lastly, the fabric has a slightly rough, scratchy feel, which seems characteristic of today's technical fabrics.  It's not clear to me that the cost in \"hand\" is worth the added function of \"wicking\" in this instance.

Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.\n\nI wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like \"old men's\" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.\n\nI am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.",

My tour guide in Israel was stupefied by them when I demonstrated the following: flex your knee, raising your calf until parallel with the ground, keeping your foot perpendicular to the ground, and--even without having to clench your toes--the clog WILL NOT fall off. Eytan watched spellbound as I did this over and over. The secret? You'll notice that your foot gets slightly wider behind the metatarsal heads and then narrows again in both directions (phalangead AND calcad, as podiatrists might say). The Boston is so expertly crafted--and so balanced for an anatomically perfect foot--that the material will stretch just wide enough to admit those protuberant metatarsal heads, then spring back just tight enough to hold them in place.

Birks are a sacred thing, and we can't just allow anyone to call them \"Birks\" now, can we? If we did, there would be total anarchy.\n\nI own three pairs of this particular model. They are all the same color and I get teased a lot because who on earth would buy three pairs of sandals that look exactly the same? Well, I would. I have my grubby pair that I wear when I'm at the beach and I don't care if they get wet or torn up by rocks if I happen to go look in the tidepools and such, I have my casual pair that I wear to barbecues and church...yeah, I wear sandals to church...what about it? Jesus did...and then I have my nice pair that I wear to work and events where I don't want my wife to be completely embarrassed by the fact that I'm wearing sandals...she still is, but in my mind I'm justifying the fact because I'm wearing the \"nice ones\". In fact, my wife usually calls the returaunt that we might be dining at to see if it's appropriate to wear sandals and if it isn't, I really don't want to eat there. Dang elitists.\n\nI'm thinking of getting another pair. Will I throw out the oldest pair? No. You don't throw out the Mona Lisa cuz it's old, do you? It is sooo obvious that you have never owned a pair of Birkenstocks. \n\nAre they pricey? Yeah, sure...a lot more pricey than those Fakenstocks you're wearing, but they'll last a lifetime and maybe even longer.\n\nSo get a pair today...get two pairs...heck, get three pairs...and no, I am not being paid for my endorsement of this product in any way.\n\n\nI firmly believe that when your feet are happy, you're happy.

A big one. Its actually just the right size for me, and I am sure you will have no problem fitting in it/filling it. The lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.\n\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\" I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it. Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)\n\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show. Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded. But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear. I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk.\n\nThis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature. My only complaint is that the leg openings do not \"cling\" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc. But that is just minor.\n\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.\n\nMay I suggest you go for the extra-bold 2(x)ist No Show Trunk 3133C, which comes in contrasting colors - same product, same price, just sexier!\n\nI cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection",

No corners to negotiate, and no top cover to flip up and hold out of the way while you butterfinger your camera in and out of the case.  Pretty weatherproof and shockproof, too.  It provides great protection for your camera.\n\nI got a little carried away and kept the USB cable for my camera in the accessory pocket along with two extra batteries and a media card.  And this actually worked for several months (!) before I broke the zipper.  I could have bought a differently designed replacement case locally--there are dozens and dozens of them--but none were anything like as suited to my needs and tastes as this little CaseLogic.  So I ordered another one from Amazon exactly like the one I ruined.\n\nIf there's anything I'd change about the case, it would be to add a small hand strap.  But that's not been an issue for me.  If I want to carry it in my hand, I just slip a finger through the belt look and carry it that way.\n\nI've learned my lesson about storing the USB cable in the accessory pocket.

It arrived a month ago and I love it!  Its the perfect weight for those summer rain storms, has a great vent in the back to keep you cool, and the fit is excellent.  Columbia really did their research on the fit.  The hood fits nicely into the collar without being too heavy around your neck when you have it stored.  The price is amazing too.  It shocked me when I opened the box and saw a $49 price tag hanging from it when I payed $20 less than that!  Great, great jacket",

        "reviews": "Hanes makes an excellent white traditional brief for the gentlemen amongst us who just don't want to wear boxers. The relatively snug fit ensures that these briefs will not \"bunch up\" like loose fitting boxers so often do; and many men prefer these briefs for that reason alone.\n\nThe briefs are easy to care for; they are essentially permanent press so any washer and dryer set will clean them well. They seem to last forever, too, which makes them an excellent value.\n\nIf you can, try to get these without a tag in the rear so that you won't get an itch caused by the tag. However, even with a tag you usually don't feel any discomfort. I've worn 'em that way for years without a problem. The 100% cotton fibers of these briefs add to the comfort you'll feel, too. \n\nMy only real caution--and the main reason that this product gets four stars instead of five--is that these briefs can be tight the first several times you wear them. This may be true for some of us men even if Hanes does claim that these briefs are preshrunk before they hit the store's shelves. I personally would suggest washing them once or twice just to loosen the fit up ever so slightly. Another relatively minor concern is that the elasticity of the waistband eventually does wear out. At that point you do need to buy new briefs--but, then again, nothing lasts forever, right?\n\nOverall, gentlemen who want a close fitting brief that still gives them comfort will be very satisfied with these white men's briefs. The three pack gives you value and they last a long time.",

I found that in hats with the Bailey Wool-Felt hat.\n\nIts comfortable and because of its material, you don't have to baby it like some hats.  If something smashes it down, it can easily be reformed back to its original shape.  The hats style alone does not say cowboy or retired yuppie, but has more practicality to it that represents an adventurer or even just an \"average joe\" with class.  Its a working mans hat to wear to town, or a city mans hat to wear while relaxing by a stream after a day of fly fishing.  \n\nMake sure to check the sizing chart if you are ordering online (I use my baseball caps, which have the sizing mark on the inside tag, as a reference) otherwise it might be best to try one on at the store and make sure it fits.  I like the way they have various sizes that encompass different exact measurements, that way no matter what, you'll find the size you are looking for.  I only say this because with baseball caps I've had trouble finding the cap I like in the pro back (non adjustable) size I need.\n\nI found the drawstring a nice addition but not something I really needed as there are never to high of winds whenever I'm wearing mine.  A nice change of pace and a statement in simple style, the Bailey Wool-Felt hat is affordable, durable, and classic",

But in your systemI am still waiting becouse goods will go to NJ and my friend repack and transport to me. Today I contacted with him and thereis no news from my goods. He is working in fedex. I have no any bad things about Amazon or Bargain Outfitter, or Guide Gear companies. But I can not understand your system. I must purchase something from a/m companies and receive it max after 5 days.\nAnother sample last year (12.12.2006) I had purchased some shoes from JC Penney company and goods will came same way (to NJ and To TR) and I am still waiting. I wisited USA several times since 1960 and I can not beleive it.\nThis is last sample. I want to purchase some decoys from company \"Mack's Prairie Wings\" but they can not ship directly to Turkiye.\n\nBut this not end of every thing. I will purchase some goods from Amazon for timeless (i.e. necessary for next year) goods but When I need urgent I will prefere speed companies.\n\nThanks alot kind interest.\nBest regards.\n\nBahadir Yamalioglu",

I did this workout one time with the 8 lb. ball and have not been able to do any kind of exercise since. I am entering my second week of taking pain killers for my messed-up lower back. There are several segments (including ab work) where the ball is held with straight arms and moved from the down position to up over the head as well as twisting side-to-side. While doing these moves, I kept thinking that they really did not seem sound for that much weight. Sure enough by that evening I was dying! Perhaps they'd be ok if you used the lightest weight ball. I am in good shape and have actually been doing the P90X extreme workouts. I am accustomed to using 20-40 lb. weights and do Tae Kwon Do and I do not have any back problems. I snatched this up when I finally found it for a good price and did it on an off day. Just be forewarned-it is really easy to hurt your back with this workout. I LOVE ALL the other Firm workouts but will never do this one again. Additionally, when I received this from Amazon the ball was misshapen & the DVD case was broken from the weight of the ball.

Reading the previous review I figured they will be exactly my size. Big mistake!..When I got them,even bofore I tried them on,I measured the waist. They were true to the L size. I had few M size swimwear around and I compared the waist...it was an inch larger then anything size M. So whoever sugested to get one size biger was wrong!Or maybe he had wishfull thinking about his waist size..;)\n\n        Now the good news..they stretch! So the L size still looked ok on me,because they didn't stretch at all. I have some wrinkels showing but it's nothing major.\n\n        The product itself is a high quality product. They look sexy..,but you have to have the right body for them too. Don't expect to look good if you are fat.They will make you look even fatter! They are not that low rise either,my butt crack isn't showing. The picture is actually very accurate and you can see how high they sit.\n\n     As far as \"you can see everything\"..as another reviewer mentioned, maybe he was comparing them to his boardshorts? I don't see any big difference between these trunks and any other smimwear in the same style. They are definetly not \"see through\"!\n\n     I'd love to exchange them for the size M....but the return policy allows absolutely no exchanges or returns,and that sucks! I wonder how different it is if I would go to their store and try them on in a fitting room? Also,it took one week for shipping.",

Then, a week later, they went BACK DOWN to $18 before I received the dresses. \n\nThe dresses do NOT look like the picture on the site. \nThe dress is longer than on the site. The site shows it above the knee's, the two I received, are below the knee, almost mid-calf...& I'm 5'9. \n\nIt is a \"halter\" top. On the site, I think they just rested the straps over her shoulders & did not tie behind her next. ALSO, I knew the dress was cotton, NOT T-SHIRT cotton sundress. \n\nNow, I have two dresses that I'm not really happy w/. I haven't had time to return them. I bought them looking for a sundress to wear out & about...this, I would probably only wear as a beach cover up or to the pool. Haven't decided. \n\nOnce I get around to getting to a post office, I plan on returning them. I keep trying them on, thinking, \"Ok, it's only $20, I should keep them.\" But I most probably would NOT have bought them if I tried them on in the store. \nThey would look cute if they were shorter, but that is more money that I would have to spend to shorten the dress. So is it really worth it??? \nHaven't decided yet. The fact I can't decided what to do w/ them, makes me believe I need to return them. If I loved them, I would have already worn them, but I haven't. \n\nThe ONLY nice thing I can say, is the pattern & colors (both the red & the blue) are really pretty.

What we really want is a pair that 1) Feels good, 2) Looks good, 3) Lasts long, and 4) Isn't too expensive.  Finding all four of these traits in one pair of pants can be tricky, but it can be done.\n\nWrangler has designed the perfect pair of jeans!  They offer a variety of cuts, sizes, and styles so that it is easy to find a pair that fits perfectly (which, incidentally, jeans that fit look much better than jeans that don't) even if you are going for the \"baggy, pants hanging at the knees\" look.  Regular, relaxed, angler or carpenter, all of the cuts and style feel great.  Also, they are really inexpensive and readily available at Amazon.com, Wal-Mart, or any nearby equivalent.\n\nI am really hard on my jeans.  I am constantly wearing holes in them, ripping them, setting them on fire, etc.  I have found no jeans that last as long as Wranglers do.  I have tried other department store brands like Levi, Old Navy or Dickies, which wear out quickly (some even disintegrate washing them!) and I have tried more upscale, even designer brand jeans like Evisu, True Religion or Dolce & Gabbana which don't hold up to the wear and tear of everyday life.  Wranglers have outlasted them all, and on top of that, they are still cheap enough to replace easily if something catastrophic does happen.\n\nOne word of warning that really applies to all brands of jeans, however, is that the more bleached or stonewashed the jeans you buy are, the faster they are going to wear out.  If you are really looking for value, the dark dark blue jeans are the ones that will last the longest, and you may get, depending on how much you wear them, another six months to a year out of them.  The stonewashed is the \"in\" look, however, and they are still really good jeans even if they don't last as long.\n\nThere may be other jeans out there in the world that are as good as Wranglers, but I've honestly stopped looking now that I've found these.  They do the job and I am happy to wear them 308 days a year",

Though this has been somewhat jokingly christened 'the bedtime slipper,' for looseness off the foot, the line on working feet is very visible, especially after repeated use.  Where Bloch and Capezio tend to require multiple fittings and testing of different styles- especially through mail order- Sansha styles, as long as they are purchased in the correct approximate widths and lengths, will mold to individual feet and stand for years with good care.  \n\nThe only reservation I have about these shoes is the leather soles' capacity for holding onto everything they pass over for an extended period of time.  If you dance in a meticulous studio, this is not an issue, but where a stray drop of soda or Gatorade is occassionally spilt, you may want to scuff the soles once a week.

It took a couple of days to break the shoes in due to the firm footbed and heel cup, but once they were broken in, it was bliss. A good friend of mine recently had plantar fasciitis herself and also began wearing the Arizona Birks. Ever since my own PF episode, I've avoided going barefoot around the house and wear only the Arizona Birks while indoors. They've held up remarkably well, and I dread the day something accidentally happens to them which means I have to buy another pair of Arizonas just in case.\n\nI know they're more expensive than most sandals -- mine cost $110 at a mall store -- but they're worth the money. I have flat feet, while my friend has a really high arch, yet the Arizona Birks work wonderfully for both of us. I now have about 12 pairs of Birkenstocks in a variety of styles, and plan on buying more. Birkenstocks give tremendous support with its toe grip and molded footbed, especially since it conforms to your foot within a few days.

Unless you like interrupting your run every five minutes to go searching for your missing sensor, the shoe pouch is definitely the way to go. The best part is that it's versatile - I can move it from my Asics running shoes to my Keen trail running shoes in a matter of seconds. Distance accuracy is spot on. Service and delivery times from Grantwood were excellent; I got the pouch in a matter of days. If you're not a fan of Nike shoes and want an inexpensive but well-designed solution, I would highly recommend this product",

        "reviews": "I have 43 years of hiking, backpacking and peak bagging experience. In recent years I migrated, like most people, from all-leather European-style mountain boots to lighter fabric/leather combination boots. They seemed to work well for a while but two years ago I started experiencing significant pain in my toes, instep and heel. I concluded that my lightweight boots from a well known outdoor supplier were a contributing factor, if not the root of the problem because they didn't provide sufficient torsional (side-to-side) rigidity.\n\nDanner's advertisement for the \"Terra Force\" boot support system convinced me to buy the Radical GTX two years ago.\n\nThe first thing I liked about the Radicals was the roomy box toe area that eliminated occasional rubbing problems caused by my prior boots' smaller toe box. There was also plenty of instep space for my high arch. Unlike many boots that now come in a single width the Radical's multiple widths allow a wider fit in the ball of the foot while retaining the snug heel fit that prevents blisters.\n\nThe Terra Force torsional support has not diminished after 250+ miles of hiking. Besides day hikes and 2-3 day backpacks I've used the Radicals with good results on off-trail scrambles to summits in the High Sierra and North Cascades, occasionally crossing snow steep enough to require an ice axe. Despite offering much more support than my prior lightweight boots the Radicals are hardly heavier (my size 10.5-EE's weigh 52 ounces). Best of all, after switching to the Radicals my toe and instep problems ceased almost immediately, and my heel problems have gradually diminished substantially, all of which I attribute to the superior support of the Terra Force system.\n\nIn my opinion these boots have too many seams and different pieces of leather and fabric, but I'm not marking down my rating because that's how virtually all lightweight, relatively inexpensive boots are made these days",

The stitchings around the border were soft. But when I felt the stitchings around the click wheel hole I can see why there were alot of complaints of ipod scratching around there. The sitchings were a bit more rough aound the click wheel than it is around the screen. But from other reviews i have read, there were no scratches from long term use of the case.\n\nBut i have nothing to worry about because I have kept the plastic adhesive sheet that came with the iPod. So I suggest to those who want to be cautious, try buying the adhesive protective sheet if you dont have it or you could just wrap your iPod in saran wrap.\n\nAfter just taking my iPod out it left some sticky residue on the back, ugh, took me forever to rub it off the edges but it still left some residue. On the sides with in the base there is a lining of glue...figures. \nBut its still a good case. Guess you just have to fully cover your ipod front and back before putting it in",

It is very large. This may be a good thing to some as there is plenty of room for deposit receipts , register etc. For women it really isn't a big problem if they have a pocketbook with ample room. It isn't a \"feminine\" item by any means. It is designed more for men. Though it will take the room of a whole pocket to carry it. Being a woman myself, I really don't mind the fact that it isn't feminine looking. I don't plan on using it for fashion. I just want a checkbook cover that won't fall apart in a years time and one I can keep more than a few checks in. For my needs it is working out fine. I wish it was a tad smaller, but then there wouldn't be all that room. You always have to trade off one thing for another in almost anything you have. All in all this is just what I wanted.",

It was certainly WELL worth the price I paid. \n\nIf you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply do not want to flash your waistband for any reason, then this brief is for you. Period. \n\nFor those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or the like, then you do not NEED this, but you still very well may WANT it. \n\nClearly this brief is meant to do two things (1) make it so that you can wear very low-rise pants and (2) make it so you look irresistable when you are NOT wearing your low-rise pants. \n\nI found that even though the underwear is cotton - as opposed to the synthetics of the X-Factor line, for example, this brief still conforms to my body's contours pretty well. Actually very well everywhere except it bunches a LITTLE where it meets the very inside of my thigh. Regardless, this is going to show off everything you got, and subsequently make it look (more-or-less) more impressive. \n\nPractical consideration: the pouch and the area above is reduced in size since it is accomodating the very low-rise. Translation: be cautious when you get aroused as there is not a great deal of \"expansion room\". Enough said on that, but that is why I gave this pair 4/5 stars. Everything else is great. I never had a problem with my rear being exposed in these briefs. \n\nIf you forsee this as being a problem for you, then may I suggest the 2(x)ist Contrast Countour Pouch Brief 3103C? It is the same price (at review time) and the same materials but in a standard cut and features sexy contrast lines. I own it as well and you may read my review about it on its product page",

        "reviews": "As I just bought two more Action Shape bras, I was compelled to write about how much I love them...\n\nA little over 10 years ago, my sister turned me on to them.  Genetically, we're predisposed to big bustlines, which has its advantages and disadvantages - one of the latter trying to find bras that fit and support and still look good.  I've tried many, many other sports bras (trying to find one from the $20 range that works) and none of the other compare - the racerback types don't give me enough support - other 'high compression' bras create that oh-so-unattractive 'uniboob' look; underwire sports bras have a very short life - they're a pain to keep washed and it doesn't take long for the underwire to pop out of the underarm area (ouch - always seemed to happen during a heavy workout!), et cetera.\n\nThe Champion Action Shape takes care of ALL of that.  There is enough separation where this looks fine even wearing under a shirt (I've even been able to wear this bra under a blouse or sweater if I'm planning on going horseback riding after work).  The straps and fasteners are totally adjustable.  The bra is mostly cotton, there might be some lycra or polyester there but I'm a cotton freak - no itchiness, no seams that chafe, and best of all NO UNDERWIRE!  It's totally supportive - as I mentioned, I ride horseback (this trumps the popular rider's \"No Bounce Bra\" that sells for over $50 and has a ton of hooks - like a corset - UGH), and am also a gym rat, doing high-impact aerobics, weight training, Spinning, Pilates and yoga - this bra is EMINENTLY suitable for all those activities.  Care is easy - just toss it in the washer and dryer or air dry (I generally airdry as the hooks have a tendency to get caught in the 'holes' in the dryer).  And they look GOOD.  I just wear this as a top on its own.\n\nBTW Champion has come out with a new color this year - Champion RED.  I just got it and it looks AWESOME!\n\nHIGHLY recommended",

However, I will add some additional information that they did not necessarily mention.\n\nThese socks are obviously well made and fairly thick.  However, they are not too thick which is a concern that I had.  They are much thicker and softer than Gold Toes Cotton Crew socks, but you must also pay for this i.e. $9.00 vs. $15.00.  On the other hand, I estimate these socks will stand up to laundering better, last much longer and will stay up with repeated washing.\n\nThe exact composition of these socks is:  84% combed cotton, 15% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  The less expensive socks I reference above are 82% combed cotton, 17% stretch nylon and 1% spandex.  One would think this wouldn't make much difference in terms of durability, but there seems to be more weight and material overall in the higher quality socks.\n\nI have also had some experience with the WHITE COTTON CREW socks and while they are absorbent because of the high cotton content, I don't feel they held up to repeated washing well.  I also don't think they are much better than less expensively priced socks by other manufacturers.  However, the WHITE FLUFFIES are a quantum leap up and worth the extra money",

I've been reasonably happy with the Bravado line in general -- they hold up very, very well, stay comfortable, and remain supportive over time-- but I just wasn't fond of the sports bra styling of their original one.  I am often between bra sizes (between 34 and 36, between B and C cups, depending on the maker) and due to a habit of nursing more on the right side than the left, often have one breast larger than the other.  The 36C fits me very comfortably with no noticeable bunching,lines, or that nasty \"spillover\" when it's been too long between feedings.  I wear fairly fitted cotten shirts just about every day of the year so it's really important to me to have a bra that fits smoothly.  The only other nursing bra that I've found that works as well under t-shirts is a Mimi brand one that it costs just about as much, but doesn't hold its shape for very long.

Bean, Fox Racing Inc., and Timberland (and Barney's New York for that matter) stock up on great, genuinely tough, useful, comfortable, and attractive clothing like these shorts--and everything else Carhartt makes.  These are clothes that make you feel and look good (\"comfort clothes\" you might say) while you're rolling around in the dirt or even on your living room floor.\n\nI laude the previous reviewer's honesty in saying they're great for wearing without underwear in the hot weather, because they really, really are.  Jeans / denim and most cotton cloth can get hot, and that can be  real uncomfortable particularly for a man's 'bait and tackle;' whereas this cloth breathes exceptionally well.  They're particularly great for after doing endurance sports and taking a shower--when you're body is still all reved up--as a loose, comfortable cool-down clothing that you're fine wearing the rest of the day.\n\nThe pockets and loops are also very handy, not only for working on a car, bike, or doing construction, but also plenty big enough to carry your cell phone (even my Treo), keys, and wallet comfortably without being like those huge, ugly military-style thigh pockets.\n\nI expect Carhartt might someday start marketing itself just like other great, functional brands that went hip-hop style or suburb/country sheik, and if they do it will be a real loss.  But for now at least we can enjoy another in that long series of brands that became famous for function before it was popularized as a suburban teenager fashion and then ruined.",

Surprisingly, it was the best thing I purchased when I was pregnant. I actually was able to get away with not buying any maternity clothes and just wearing my old clothing but with the pants or jeans unzipped and unbuttoned. In the last month, however, I had to wear more stretchy clothes- even my jeans would not fit with the bella band. But it is great because you can have it peek out from under the shirt you are wearing for a layered look. It is just a great product. Can't say enough good things about it. I am now pregnant with my 2nd child and have used the same bella band. It really keeps its elasticity.

At one point during the day I wondered if I had on a six and took them off to check.  I wondered if I had bought a nine & a half if I would have gotten a better fit. What I found odd is that when I fitted them on their arrival they were fine it is the continuous wearing that revealed the discomfiture",

At the end, I was definately ready to put it down, so it did work me out.\nPros: Different change of pace using the ball; lots of moves that strengthen your core; a fun and different stretch at the end using the ball; Tina Smalley is a precise leader that is easy to follow.\nCons: I miss the old FIRM master instructors that were in all the other videos. Just Allie and Allison were in this one. They didn't even introduce the others. There was no changes in weight, which used to be the way to spot an \"ineffective workout\" according to the \"old\" FIRM tapes. And lastly, In my humble opinion, the ball is a little gimicky. A good 5lb weight held on the dumbell ends would work about the same. \n  Still worth giving it a shot for different days. You'll sweat, but you'll wonder, \"Is this REALLY the FIRM?",

But I didn't want to go all out and get those tiny suits that Olympic swimmers and Europeans wear so this was a nice compromise.\n\nRemember that it's a snug, tight suit so if you normally wear a Medium pair of surfing trunks, you'll want a Large size here cause it will feel uncomfortably tight and make you feel VERY self-conscious when you step out of the changing room.\n\nMaterial is very good.  It stretches well, dries quickly.  The elastic in the waistband, however, is not attached so everytime you take off the suit, the waistband elastic gets all twisted around.  It's not difficulat to manually twist 'em back into shape --but it's still annoying.\n\nBecause it's so snug, there are no pockets of any kind and no place to put your locker key.\n\nOverall, it's a good product.  But you better not be self-conscious about your body --this is the man's equivalent of a thong bikini (considering how modest men's --at least American men's-- swimwear has become).  I felt very self-conscious at first but since I only wore them to the gym to swim laps, I didn't care so much about how I looked and I really appreciated the fact that this was comfortable to swim in.  But now, after a year of dedicated working out, I'm starting to look GOOD and these swimtrunks really accentuate the broad shoulders and tight abs.  I even wear them around the house cause it drives my wife nuts (in a good way).  And now that James Bond wore something like these in Casino Royale, it won't be too weird for me to wear this to the beach this summer",

        "reviews": "Gold Toe makes an excellent sock and their \"Men's Canterbury Dress Sock\" is no exception. The socks are remarkably comfortable. They are not thick; and although they are a bit thinner than other Gold Toe socks they will still withstand lots of wear. They almost never \"bunch up\" inside my shoes as I walk around and they are very much worth the price. They last longer so the long life of these socks justifies the slightly higher price.\n\nI also like the design of the toe section actually being gold colored fabric. Amazon points out that these socks come in your choice of four different colors: black, navy blue, grey marl and brown. The safest, most conservative choice for the corporate office is the black color; but the other colors come in handy too depending on your work/play \"dress code.\"\n\nThese socks can easily be washed in any washer or dryer--but I would heed the manufacturer's warning about not drying them at a high temperature. High temperatures in the clothes dryer cause the sock to wear out faster. The stretch nylon will stretch even more; and then these socks will become just too loose on your feet.\n\nPlease note that these are crew length socks. They will not come up your leg to the degree that some other socks will. You may consider them to be \"too short.\" On the other hand, the socks also fit shoe sizes 7 through 12 so it's almost one size fits all. \n\nOverall, Gold Toe is the brand to buy if you want good quality, long lasting socks. The \"Canterbury Dress Socks\" for men match any attire and they can even be worn in bed on those really cold nights to keep your feet warm! \n\nHighly recommended! May you wear them in good health!     SMILE",

When I got home and tried them on again, without the nylon sock as I would normally be wearing them, it was a way tighter fit, especially across the toes. My pinky toe was killing me! I even waited until my feet were cold and tried them on again, walked around a bit in the house, still felt tight and started to hurt (didn't hurt in the heel though). \n\nI didn't bother trying on the 8 at the store because 8s are usually way too big on me, especially in high heels. I'm pretty much always a true 7.5 unless I'm wearing a narrow-cut ballet flat. I wouldn't say my feet are wide, but they are not narrow either, maybe if you have narrow feet you could wear these easily in your true size, everyone else -- go up half a size (especially because patent leather is stiffer than regular leather)! I noticed a huge difference in the feeling of the width across the toes in the size 8 - my pinky toe was no longer being strangled. \n\nI went back to the store this morning, tried the 8 (without the nylons) and they fit perfectly!

I have never used it while biking but if you ever visit San Francisco, California you will see almost every bike messenger using this bag",

Makes you look wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway.. TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by Wacoal that is great also. This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...

        "reviews": "I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?\n\nAmong the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!\nNext, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  \n\nIt was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...\n\nThat's not all the changes.....\n\nThey've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.\n\nThe front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....\n\nThe back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.\n\nThey claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.\n\nNext, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.\n\nFinally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.\n\nDo you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.\n\nI spent 30 minutes on the phone with a \"specialist\" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.\n\nI spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.\n\nBUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN\"T.\n\nIF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE \"OLD\" VERSION.\n\nSO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO \"FIX\" THEM????",

        "reviews": "If you've been looking for a great pair of yoga pants for an active practice, look no further. These knicker-length pants(4 or 5 inches below your knee, depending on your height) are made of an 88% organic cotton, 12% Spandex blend. The material is just the right thickness for a sweaty practice (like Baptiste Power Yoga)-- fairly thin, but not skimpy feeling, wicks well enough, holds some moisture, but doesn't get or feel drenched during your practice.  Verve is a small Colorado company that makes clothes for climbers.  That background shows in these pants -- the fit is just right, not tight (like a pair of long johns), but roomy (and stretchy) enough to allow easy movement between poses. Verve makes a longer Hanuman pant, that I have not tried.  I really like the knickers because they let you see correct positioning of your feet and don't have surplus fabric that might get in your way -- really good for Tree pose, for example",

The pair Im replacing are Betulas and I bought them 3yrs ago. As it turns out, you can have Birkenstock sandals repaired over time as long as the cork isnt too badly damaged. All one has to do is take them to a liscensed dealer and 25.00 later, you have a repaired pair of sandals. \n\nOther brands can come up with knockoffs, but nothing matches a true anatomically correct Birkenstock. \n\nI suggest going to a store that sells Birkenstocks and seeing what size your largest foot is before buying online so as to avoid the hassle of having to mail back the sandals and trying to get the correct size. Once you have all the necessary info, you are set to buy them to your feet's content. You wont regret buying these sandals. The comfort is unmatched.

For this particular style I was told over the phone that they don't carry the short/medium/long varieties and my only chance of getting an inseam of 34-35'' would be to go for the large size which also has a waistline of 35-39''.  I ended up getting the large one as suggested which is a bit too wide for my friend.\n\nOther than that I'm happy with the product quality and the service I received",

I can't explain exactly how the older pair is but there is a slight look and feel of a difference. I still like the older ones better. Not sure if I'll ever find the same ones again. Oh and one last thing, if I could give shoe and clothing stores one tip, it would be to make adult sizes for the children's items. They make some really cool things for kids today.

Yet they are as cute as regular ballet flats.  I'm going to buy another pair in silver.  As for the other reviewers complaining about a poor fit -- I wouldn't buy these shoes online unless you have tried them on in a store first, but if you DO buy them try them on at home before going out so you can return them if they don't fit.

In any event, if you can't get a sale item that you like better than this at Orvis.com, you'll at least feel you got a halfway decent price for this thick, warm, and surprisingly good-looking sweater.  While not made in Ireland, it has that sheep-yarn-crofter-whiskey-handmade look, and you can lie about its origin with ease.  THe medium heft fits its design and function, and the colors coordinate well: You will not look garish or overdressed.\n\nIn short, it's one of their few patchwork type items that really works (another being the \"Irish cap).  For examples of this concept taken to a ridiculous extreme, look for the patchwork Madras, as just one example.  While you're at it, find the corduroy pants with the dogs on it. It's \"country gentleman\" on steroids; the Hamptons after a few too many ethanol teas.\n\nBut this is a good one...you'll like it. PLease note two things: THe back is not patchwork but a tan-beigy solid (that's ok), and while it's machine washable, it's best to hand dry it or dry clean to prevent shrinking and wear.",

If you are looking for the 501 fit without the hassle of buttons, this may be the way to go.  The 505 is rather full in the seat and crotch (technically \"the rise\") and can look pretty baggy.  Though described as a \"slim fit\", the 512 is more of a moderate fit,  snug but not formfitting, much like the handsome 501.  Rather than slim fit, it really should be described as the 512 \"tapered leg\", because it has a pretty strong taper to the ankle, which means it will not fit over boots, unlike the 505 and the 501.  The only real downside of this jean is that comes in only one finish, a rather milquetoast medium stonewash.  Over time, however, it breaks in pretty nicely and looks good.",

The main difference is that there is less sewing detail on the rear pockets and on the side just below the waist, and no red tab on the rear pocket.  The finishes are mainstream stonewash in light, medium and dark.  If you can live with this limited choice of finishes you can save a few bucks by buying the Levi Strauss Signature jeans.

And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Lands End's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.

When I first get them, I just wear them around the house occasionally until I can actually wear them out for a bit.

I looked around for a while before going with this package deal and I'm happy I took the time to do so. \n\nThe case is snug enough so your Zen won't move around in it but it doesn't button mash either. The download/charging port on the bottom is large enough to allow the adapter to plug in easily - so once the case goes on you never really have to take it off. The power switch, headphone jack, and microphone all have openings that are completely functional. The belt clip, kick stand and arm band are all bonus add-ons that can be used or not depending on your needs. And finally the flip screen helps protect your valuable screen which is the main reason I bought this. \n\nThe film screen protector is difficult to put on without leaving any air bubbles underneath so I took mine off in the end. Fortunately, these can be found almost anywhere unlike this case and package that comes with it. And all of this for under $10??? A great deal on an excellent product. Highly recommended",

The best part is the way they make me feel when I'm wearing them... daring, feminine, and downright sexy! They are also a great way to show off a naughty wax :) You won't be disappointed!",

Ok, some stuff you need to know......this bag will charge your cellphone, ipod, pda, camera, and AA and AAA batteries (ipod and batteries require purchase of seperate adaptors.  you can find them at [...])  I think it takes about 6-8 hours to charge from nothing using the sun, but you can confirm that on the above website.  It also has an adaptor to charge the battery at home or in the car.  This backpack will NOT charge your laptop.  The space provided for the solar collection isn't big enough.  There are seperate solar arrays that you can purchase that fold up and go in a backpack (i've seen them for about $200).  The upside to the backpack is that you don't have to be stationary for it to be collecting power, unlike the folding arrays.   I wear mine while walking around chicago, or cycling to and from work and school.  The bag isn't much heavier than a \"non-solar\" bag.  Infact, once i put all my school books in it, i couldn't tell the difference between the weight of this one and my old bag. Even in the cold chicago winter, i can get a charge on a relatively clear day.  (i.e.  it doesn't have to be hot outside, just sunny.)  Also, be aware that this bag has a battery that stores the power you collect until you're ready to use it, some other manufactures have no battery, which means that you have to be in the sun when you want to charge something.  I didn't purchase my bag through amazon, (though i must say i'm thrilled that they are carrying it now.)  I dealt directly with voltaic systems, and their customer service is on point.  i hope this review was helpful to you",

I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors.",

As yet I haven't found a use for the very small side zippered pockets near the belt.  The leather is very good quality and the brown is a warm medium shade.  All zippers work well.  Extra large belt.  I am a new fanny pack wearer, so it does take some getting used to the  bulk and weight in the front waist area, but it beats the strain of shoulder straps, hand bags, etc.  I use the cell phone pocket for my hearing aid volume/program adjustment device, the size of a small cell phone.

I think this one does that effectively by using the pouch and the dramatic contrast lines.  I ordered the black and white to make a real impact, and trust me - it does.\n\nThe fit is great, there is enough room for everything and although it is cotton, it stretches and shapes to my body just as well as the synthetic materials on the 2(x)ist X-Factor Countour Pouch Brief 7403 do (see my review on that product page as well).  I would suggest that brief as well, but you will lose out on the sexy contrast lines.\n\nIf you seem to like this brief, may I suggest you shake things up a little a consider ordering the 2(x)ist Contrast No-Show Trunk 3133C?

My only regret (like everyone else who has reviewed it) is that I did not buy one in each color! I monitor Amazon's prices almost every 2 hours so hopefully I'll be able to buy a couple more when the prices drop!\n\nThe jacket is definitely great quality -- nicely lined and does not smell or stink, sign of high-quality tanning process. (I'm wearing another non-washable suede jacket that cost 4 times more and it reeks of tannins. Ugh.)\n\nA caveat, though: I did not go by Amazon's sizing chart. I searched all over the web for Live A Little/AMI's size charts and Nordstrom's has it. Go by that chart instead of Amazon's for a perfect fit!\n\nFor those who hesitated the last time, when this baby drops in price again, go for it!

THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE QUALITY FOR THE MONEY! A NICE MEDIUM WEIGHT,WITH MUCH ATTENTION TO DETAIL. I LOVE THE SNAPS DOWN THE FRONT, AS WELL AS ON THE CUFFS [I PURCHASED A MEN'S 2XL,NORMALLY WEAR SIZE 22/24] AND WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE SLEEVES BEING TOO LONG. WITH THE SNAP ON THE CUFFS, NO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THE LENGTH! LOTS OF ROOM TO SPARE, SINCE I WILL HAVE A SWEATSHIRT OR LIGHTWEIGHT JACKET UNDERNEATH. THIS WILL REALLY SERVE THE PURPOSE AND I'M SURE I'LL USE THIS FOR OTHER THAT FISHING TRIPS TOO!  THIS WOULD BE A GREAT JACKET FOR AN EVEN HIGHER PRICE-----YOU WON'T BE SORRY",

Also rest assured, they do hold up to wear and tear. I was skeptical when I bought these how long they'd stay intact, but I can attest that they are still in and functional... kinda mangled, but still intact and functioning.\n\nAlso, if you think you're just gonna swing your leg up and crack open a beer like Mr. Joe Cool, then think again. I remember when I first got these I was at a backyard house party while in San Diego. I was flirting with these two girls, talkin' my game and trying to be super cool. So I grab another beer, and while talking to them, I lift my foot and try to crack the bottle open. Well, between trying to keep my balance and get the lip of the cap in the opener, I apparently shook it up a bit. When I finally did open it, the resulting explosion of foam shot all over me and the two girls. Not cool.\n\nI would suggest taking the sandal off to use the bottle opener feature.\n\nAll and all, a great shoe. Fun and easy to wear.\n\nAnother tip: Make sure you wash these every so often! Stick 'em in the washing machine. I neglected to do this and developed a nasty case of athlete's foot from them. Just a heads up. Enjoy",

        "reviews": "I am a physical therapist.  When I got pregnant, I was concerned about my back and how it would hold up during the pregnancy.  With the hormone relaxin that is released with pregnancy, our joints loosen up and can't support as much as they do in a non-pregnant state.  This is especially notable at the sacroiliac (SI) joint of our low backs.  Instability of this joint (there's one on each side) can lead to pain.  \n\nAt about 18 weeks I started having some SI pain.  I got one of these belts and had relief within 24 hours.  For about 2 months I wore it every day to support my SI joints.  I found that if I attached the velcro strap in the front securely, but not tight, then used the two side straps to tighten up the whole belt, I would get the best relief.  I had to be certain the two side straps were even: the seam where they meet in the back was in the CENTER of my back.  I would then pull them around at the same time and attach them so that the fit was snug, but not uncomfortable.  After a couple of months, the baby started getting so big that I started wearing it more as a support for my belly.  As I've gotten bigger and bigger, I've pulled the back part upward slightly, which continues to provide SI support but also helps hold up the baby.  When I take the belt off I REALLY notice the difference.  The support is amazing for such a simple belt (wish I had the patent!)\n\nI'm due in a month.  I have had NO back pain since before I used the belt and I continue to work and exercise without problems",

The waist and back area was way too large in the 3x. I was not only displeased with the fit but the quality of the material is poor as well. The dots are screenprinted on so after a few washes they will begin to crack and fade, it does say handwash (but even still some of the dots are already lighter than others). I'm giving the dress two stars because the style of the dress is really nice and if you can get it to fit the right way its not a bad price at all, but it's definitely not a dress that your going to have around for a long time.",

They weren't bad, but they weren't good.  If I washed them with my husband's shirts, there was just no comparison.  There were always wrinkles in my shirt.

The 4600 High could come back in more color schemes, with some colors vintage and some others contemporary.  Perhaps more \"real\" hi-tops could be brought back by Reebok and other companies as well.",

Stitching looked even and the shine was appropriate for dress wear. They are comfortable enough (maybe a little snug), but I though it was odd that they creased across (rather than to the rear of) the cap.  Within a few days, however, the skin-like coating (perhaps the waterproof layer?) of the uppers separated from the underlying leather, creating blisters in the creases.  Within a few weeks, those blisters tore, exposing the leather underneath.  I'm not sure where this will end, but at less than 2 months old, they will soon look too bad for dress wear.  And, I suspect that the waterproofing has now been compromised.  I'm glad I didn't pay full price!",

I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. \n\nWell, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.\n\nNext, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.\n\nIf you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat",

They  cost a little more than a year ago, but they are a very good quality and have lasted through many washings. \n\nThey are very comfortable,light weight and fit loose around the ab and waist area, which I prefer to something clingy. The fit is short, but not too short, hitting just below the waist. I wear it often, and found it versatile enough to wear with low-cut jeans, for sleep, yoga and working out. The color(grey) did not fade much with all the washings, but I did find that, after a while, it lost it's shape just a little and sometimes it came out a little wrinkled from the dryer(dried on low), but usually smoothed out by hand when I folded it. It did not wrinkle during wear(except when I slept in it) and it did not shrink at all.\n\nI liked the loose  fit, the comfy cool feeling of the fabric, and the quality enough to order a couple more for the hot summer coming up. I usually wear a large in most tops, but I usually go for an  X-large in short tees, so it just hits a little lower and is a little looser.\n\nAnd by the way..\"Bare Necessities\", the store I purchased this tee through, was very good with packaging and prompt delivery.\n\nIt a great buy...Happy Shopping...Lauri",

The nightgown itself has no problems - the contstruction seems sturdy, no visible flaws, and good printing, even if it is a little on the darker side.  And as she claims \"Ariel is my favorite princess\", so there was no way it wasn't going to be a hit with her.\n\nThe slippers that came with the nightgown were too small for a size 6.  They didn't even fit my three year old who wears a size 8.  I'm guessing these slippers are around a size 6.  I would have thought that they would have sized the slippers to the size of the nightgown, but now I suspect they make them \"one size fits all\" (aka \"one size too small\").  Besides being too small, there is nothing to pull up over the heel, so they constantly slip off the foot.  They were discarded after 15 minutes when my two daughters realized they looked like more fun than they actually were.\n\nThe tiarra is obviously cheaply made.  We weren't expecting any more than that.  My 4 1/2 year old left it on the ground the first evening she got it and accidentally stepped on it breaking it cleanly in half.  Honestly, I was relieved I could get rid of it that quickly.\n\nI'm giving the product 4 stars because what we were really buying was the nightgown.  The lack of 5 stars is due to the poor construction and sizing of the slippers - they could have done a better job.  The tiarra is a non-issue to us",

Zippers are a must when you are carrying documents.  Ofcourse it does make it painful to open them everytime.  But hey, which one would you prefer - losing your documents are a fews seconds to open the zippers\n  * PVC backing - The wallet comes with a firm PVC backing, so that it does not bend easily and wrinkle you documents\n  * Good looks and styling - With a swiss army logo and good quality material - people are sure to notice what you are carrying.  The wallet does not have to be made in leather, still its looks are very decent.\n\nWhere the travel wallet loses a star ?  I wish if there was another dividing compartment in the wallet",

Although they might be hard to see in the accompanying photo - both serve to give the overall garment a much more finished appearance - while also offering an attractive focal point for the eye!\n\nThe fluffy waistband on this Flutter Butt crotchless undie - also helps to accentuate your hips - by providing a little skirt-like appearance.\n\nIf you have other frilly lingerie, this crotchless knicker - by heightening the tease - might make this a very fun and memorable addition to your collection. \n\n\nFor me, my most baby-like babydoll nightie - which had a short bodice and a billowy skirt (with almost no waist) - ended up coordinating quite nicely.

The suction cups were absolutely worthless--would fall as soon as anything was placed on the line and sometimes even if nothing was placed on the line--, but since you can wrap the line around something and hook it to itself, that's not too much of a problem unless you can't find anything else for the cord to loop around. The two twisting strands were very helpful--no clips required. The only challenge I ran into was finding places to hook the cords onto--I had to get a bit creative with curtain rods and window bars, and it won't stretch across an entire room--but that is to be expected. Overall, I highly recommend.",

I usually wear a 7.5 Wide in women's shoes, but when I tried on the Primas in an 8, they were ridiculously big, and when i tried them on in a 7, they were a tad too snug. I really wish they made half sizes. I ended up buying the 7, even though it was a little small, but I read about a great trick to help mold the shoes to my feet, that works like a charm: throw them in the clothes dyer for two minutes on medium heat, then pull them out, and while they are toasty warm, immediately put them on your feet and wear them for about a half hour, and voila, they will now fit perfectly!\n\nGrade: A-",

They're beautiful little things.\n\nMany people do not know the full history of these Italian leather babies, but those who do know are of the upper echelon. The Ellesse name is based on the initials, L.S., of its founder, Leonardo Servadio, an Italian tailor with an innovative approach to styling and manufacture. In 1959, Servadio created a revolutionary stretch ski pant which established Ellesse among the elite alpine social circles, making it the ultimate aspirational brand.\n\nThe immense success of Ellesse in winter sports clothing provided a perfect passport to expand the brand and transfer the design philosophy into the equally prestigious world of tennis. In 1976, Servadio seized the opportunity to take the brand onto a worldwide stage and embarked on an aggressive sponsorship programme signing tennis legends such as Boris Becker, Chris Evert Lloyd and Guillermo Vilas.\n\nEllesse became synonymous with tennis and skiing and as a testimony to the success of Ellesse in these highly competitive fields, the Ellesse logo, consisting of half a tennis ball combined with 2 ski tips, surmounting the company name, was created.\n\nI must also warn that there are a few pairs in this particular line that have a minor defect, in which there is one shoe where the sole comes loose. This can be fixed with a little rubber cement, but if you don't want to be bothered, just send it back and have it easily exchanged, with the shipping costs reimbursed back to you. Even with that small hassle, you can't beat the sharply reduced price featured here!\n\nMy favorite pick is the White/Tan/Brown. Just be sure to keep the laces clean",

Mats that are about half a thick as this one are good for travel or placing under a thicker mat to provide more traction. The thick mats (3/16\") are about 50% thicker than this one and are designed for those who need or want extra cushion. At 24\" x 68\" it's of average length and width.\n\nThese mats are really beautiful! As a professional, I'm normally not concerned with the look of a mat; it's performance and ease of use are of primary concern. However, these mats are stunning! You'll definitely get oohs and aahs from your fellow yoga enthusiasts when you roll these out. The blue one looks like the ocean and the orange on looks like liquid lava! I especially love how the design goes all the way through the mat and isn't just 'printed' on one side. The design on your mat will last as long as your mat will. \n\nThere are two sides to this and nearly all yoga mats. Look carefully at the 'bumps' on each side of the mat. The larger bumps are designed to face upwards to cushion your hands, feet, and knees during poses while keeping your body from dangerously slipping out of alignment. The smaller bumps are designed to face downwards to grip the floor and keep the yoga mat from sliding. Many mats have a label on one end with the name of the brand. This is typically, but not always, located on the 'up' side. The bumps will tell you for sure. \n\nThis yoga mat will increase in softness and stickiness with use. (So do most mats.) They start out mildly sticky and increase in stickiness the more they are used. You will want to wash your mat when it first arrives so as to remove the thin film they get on their surface during the manufacturing process. Instructions for washing the mat are included. Once you've washed and dried your mat you're ready to begin! After using it for a while, if you find the mat decreasing in stickiness each time you pull it out, this is the typical sign that a light coating of dust or too much body sweat has accumulated on your mat and it needs a light hand washing with very diluted soap and water. After washing, roll your mat in a thick towel to squeeze out the excess water, otherwise it will take forever to dry in the air. Then, air dry your mat unrolled, inside, and away from sunlight. (Hanging over the shower bar works nicely.) \n\nWhen you first unroll your mat you will find one end to be a bit curled. Simply alternate the direction you roll your mat (top outside once, then bottom outside next) or the end you start from (curled end once, flat end next time) and you'll find it straightening out more or less over time. \n\nI recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them for you. I've worked in many studios and gyms over the years. Sometimes management has mats cleaned often, sometimes not. If you bring your own mat you always know where it's been. :o) Plus, owning your own mat may encourage you to begin valuable practice at home. \n\nFor my students who have trouble with their knees in some of the poses requiring the body weight to rest on a knee, I recommend temporarily folding over one end of the mat to get double cushion under the knee while still leaving one layer under the rest of the body. This saves you having to haul more than one mat out each time you practice which can be discouraging especially to the beginner.",

Even if you are an A or low-B. These inserts are a little heavy and require a good bra to conceal and hold them up. I personally recommend using a Fashion Forms pocket bra style 9400 or a Playtex style 4300.  Order a cup size above what you would normally wear.",

The quality seems ok - I have not washed them yet so I can't comment on the color fastness - the dark blue seems a like it may fade.The first thing I noticed was that the bodysuits are very long. They are not the stardard length you get with Gerber and Carter's etc. The 0-3 mths has the length of a normal 6-9mth bodysuit. The chest area is ok but the armholes are a bit small. In the bigger sizes the armholes seem normal. I have to wait until my son gets here to decide if I will convert the smaller ones into tees. \nThis would have gotten 5 stars if the sizing was right - Hope this helps future buyers!!!",

        "reviews": "From another review: the charger and sync adapter brick can't fully engage the player because of the leather straps, so it is easily disengaged by the slightest movement.\n\nslightest movement? i dont think so. no the adapter doesn't fit in the jack as well when it is in this case but it does fit. if your going to buy a car charger for your zen i would suggest you buy the one that you don't need the adapter for it,plus it charges faster, just like the wall charger. i only use the adapter at home. the headphone jack lines up fine. \n\nFrom another review: The fold-over flap isn't designed well. First of all, it gets in the way of the headphone jack, so that many times when I opened the flap, it pulled my headphones out of the headphone jack.\n\nThe part about the headphones is beyond me. You can put the headphones in the jack two ways. you can completely close the case, and the foldover flap and then put the headphones in, like when youre not going to be changing songs alot. I do this when I am working out at the gym. The second way is to have the headphones inserted with the case on but with the fold over flap/screen protector, open. I do this in my car so if I want to change a song while driving the buttons are right there. I have never had the headphones pull out of the jack and ive had it over three months and i wear it everyday to the ymca.\n\nand then theres....\nFinally, and this is a real deal breaker, is the fact that you cannot plug in the adapter to the bottom of the player when the case is on. You have to pull the player out every time you want to sync or charge you player, which is a big hassle.\n\nthis is also not true. i didnt think it would fit right either when i got this in the mail. but it does fit. you just can't button the case closed. i can use the adapter or my wall charger(which has the same size port as my zen, thank god) while this case is on my zen.\n\nand then...\nThe case is to small for the player. When i tryed to put the player in the case it was a tight fit, when i finally got it in the case the bottom buttons on the player were being pushed down by the case. This case also adds a lot of bulk to the player as well and is very uncomfortable to use. Don't listen to anybody who thinks this product was great, they are lying.\n\nthe case does seem tight but thats how you should want it. you don't want your zen shaking around in the case do you? this case does not press the buttons down. it does take some getting used because you have to press harder to get to the buttons. but the scroll pad is right there in the open so you don't have to worry about that.\n\nI have had this case since i bought my zen. i bought it on ebay for 10 bucks. yes it does seem to add some bulk to the zen but i like it. ive dropped it twice all ready while in this case and there is no damage. it actually seems to have some shock absorbtion due to its studriness/thickness. and people whining about the beltclip....the only time i put the zen with case in my pocket is at the gym. i put it in my pocket and the clip on the outside of my shorts. i am upside down when i do decline bench press and upside down when i do situps, it has never fallen out or even seemed like it was going to slide out of my pocket. if you care about your zen like i do this is probably the best case to get for it. best ive seen anyway. dont go for them cheap rubber/plastic covers(you know which ones i am talking about). Also on the inside of the cover/flap there is a \"secret\" slot where you can put money or an ID even. its sweet yes? high five!\n\npeople seem to be knit-picking this thing in alot of the reviews i've read. buy this case, and learn how to use it before you get on here and roast it all right? ive had it as long as i have had my zen and it is great no matter what you are doing.",

First off, they don't fit like the old CK crew necks... they are, in fact, shorter and the waist is wider. The length isn't bad- it's the waist width that is too large and makes the shirt ill-fitting. (I have an average body-type) After just a few washings, some of the stitching started coming undone, and there were loose strands on the inner parts of the shirts. I'm continually trimming these loose ends. Although that didn't affect the way these shirts fit, I would expect better stitching from CK. I do wear the shirts under sweaters or jackets, but I feel awkward wearing them on their own as outerwear due to the fit. I don't recommend these shirts.

When my last one was getting a little old I started looking for a replacement but was unable to find one locally.  I did a google search and found Amazon again and low and behold a wallet that looked just like what I use to have. I was a little hesitant at first but for the price I decided to order 2, I hate returning things and if it's right I take 2!  When they came I was happy, they were exactly what I wanted with an extra velcroed pocket inside.  If you never tried a nylon wallet but have wanted to, you ought to give this one a try.  If you are the type of guy who likes to show off 10 pictures of his children, car, wife or girlfriends this isn't for you, it doesn't come with a multi-plastic picture folder.  If you want a secure rugged container for all your wallet valuables, here's one for you! There's even a velco strip to keep your wallet closed shut, a nice added feature that will allow you to take your wallet out in total darkness without being afraid you might loose something from inside, even if you drop your wallet. I could see where this would be a good wallet for our men and women in our armed services.  Also for any outdoor enthusiast or worker or anyone who might just want a secure wallet. Heck, the black might even go with a tux",

Now, I wear an 11 narrow so I only paid 59 bucks for these and this fact does affect my review.\n\nI sold shoes for several years and learned what good shoes are and where they come from. Generally, Italian shoes are a safe bet but I tend to buy Swedish, Spanish or Brazilian because of the uniform quality. Let me tell you, Brazilian leather is some of the finest and rivals Spanish leather.\n\nThese shoes arrived and I wore them to work the next day.  I chose the CHILI color which didn't disappoint right out of the box. Mimimal soreness which is a good sign and also very light creasing on the uppers which made me happy. \n\n A minor gripe which is not aimed solely at Bostonian but does anyone welt their shoes anymore? Welting is usually the surest sign of quality and easy to discern. Welting is simply sewing through the sole of the shoe. It is faked often so beware of rubber welting.\n\nThe heel is stacked on this shoe and  it seems a good laminate job. Stacking adds stability and oomph to a heel so always go for it when you can.\n\nThe leathers on this shoe are very good for the price and display a nice patina and richness. Not quite top notch shoe leather but above-average for this range. \n\nThe stitching is very nice with no defects on either shoe.\n\nThe overall profile of this shoe is handsome and sleek -- just the way I like my oxfords. The finish is rich and deep. I received several compliments on them around the office which always helps!\n\nAll in all, I have more expensive brown oxfords in my closet but these babies are just as comfortable and attractive not to mention cheaper. A good solid work shoe",

The charger barely fits, but I keep mine in there, and over time, the case has stretched some, so it fits better.

A friend with a larger size and  medium width tells me she has worn hers \"Margie\" sandal comfortably for 12 years.  They still look new, as evidenced by my ordering them after seeing how lovely they were when she wore them to a recent event.\n\nBass always produces a good product.  I ordered the \"tan distressed\" and they are beautiful sandals, with sumptuously comfy soles.  They are adequately sturdy, while also enabling feet to still look dainty and shapely.  For the $30 which I paid, free postage, they are a fairly good buy.  \n\nNevertheless, these sandals are not perfectly comfortable for me, perhaps more my fault than theirs.  My advice to a person with small, narrow feet is that this product may not be exactly right.  The front straps are in a fixed position, as are most strappy sandals, while the back ones are adjustable.  This said, the size 7 Narrow is not for a truly narrow foot, mainly due to the positioning and size of the front straps.  \n\nI will keep these sandals and can wear them \"around,\" but on day trips or shopping I would probably not be able to endure the slight floppiness.  There is just a tad too much give for my  foot.  Even the back strap isn't quite perfect for me, as it tends to force the foot forward when adjusted in the tightest position.  Yet I need the very tightest buckle hole in order to keep the shoe on my foot at all.  \n\nWould I have bought these had I been shopping in a store, where I could have tried them on?  Probably not.  But I've been to dozens of quality shoe stores already this summer, to no avail seeking my size in this type sandal. At one point, I went store-to-store at a huge outlet mall, hitting every place with shoes, including Bass itself.  At one store, Etienne Aigner, I was so frustrated that I made the comment that they no longer carried either my size or my style.  When the saleswoman heard I wore a narrow, she said, \"Oh we'll, never go back to THOSE again.\"  It seems as if most stores consider customers with dainty, narrow feet an oddity, not deserving to find shoes at all.   So perhaps, in spite of my dissatisfaction with the sandals in question, I did well by ordering them.",

It has other cute compartments, some chilled, some not, but my family doesn't use these on a day to day basis. I think they give extra flexibility to what can be carried, though.  We ordered the same bag in 3 colors, one for each person. They look as if they will be very durable but we've only had them a couple of months.  only negative is that there is not a separate pouch for the ice pack.

And if I run, anything heavy in the cargo pockets annoyingly slaps me in the legs (all scrubs are loose-fitting on my chicken legs).

Let's face it, cargo pockets make you look like you are ready for anything (even if I have learned how to minimize the amount of stuff I needlessly carry around).

I can fit a huge beach towel, sandals, a book, my INSTYLE magazine, sunblock, a water bottle, and a wristlet inside.  You'll definitely want to bring a seperate \"wristlet\" or wallet/coin purse along with you to keep inside.  I can't wait to bring this bag on my honeymoon!  \n\nThe handbag came with an authentication card, the original ITALIAN price tag (it really WAS 500 Euros!), and a dust bag for storage.  It looks genuine with the \"PRADA\" triangle tag on one side and a leather \"PRADA label inside the bag... the labeling is subtle and not at all \"in your face\".  Perfect gift!

When my wife became pregnant, she was worried that she would have to constantly expand her wardrobe as our wonderful growing child expanded her belly (yeah, I know babies grow in uteruses, but \"belly\" just sounds so much cozier).  These Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands allowed her to wear her normal pants and skirts with the waists undone all the way up to her sixth month.\n\nAfter our child was born, my wife had no more use for the bands, but I didn't want to see them go to waste.  I have always been pretty trim, but I wondered if the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands might work for a growing beer belly as well as a growing baby belly, so I began to eat and drink excessively, allowing my belly to grow.  My wife thought I was being idiotic, but I told her that she had had her turn, so she should let me have mine.\n\nAfter gaining fifteen pounds and a noticeable paunch, the waists of my pants no longer buttoned comfortably.  I undid my pants, wrapped my belly in one of the Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands, and threw on an old oxford shirt.  After buttoning just the top few buttons of the oxford, I looked as if I were wearing a particularly snug, extra-long, patterned t-shirt underneath.  I went to my local watering hole and none of the guys recognized that I was wearing an article of my wife's clothing!\n\nI have now become a big fan of Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands, and have bought additional bands to add to my wife's collection.  Well, I suppose I should say \"my\" collection since I'm the one wearing them.  If my wife becomes pregnant again, I will, of course, share the bands with her.  Who would have thought that my wife's pregnancy and my frugality would result in the sharing of clothing between me and my beloved?  I joke to her that my \"child\" is due any day now, and then rub my belly lovingly.  My wife gives me a strange look, sighs, and then just shakes her head.  I know she's just jealous, so I tell her, \"Hey, all you have to do is become pregnant again if you want to wear these Baby Be Mine Maternity Belly Bands.\"  \"I don't know if your fathering another child is such a good idea,\" she replies.  I ask her what she means, but she just shakes her head and says, \"Never mind.",

        "reviews": "The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart.  I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.  \n\nUnfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims.  Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF.  I tried this bra on in a 38 DD.  I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support.  Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all.  That is not the effect I want when I go strapless.  Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety",

They are not too wide nor too narrow. They offer a decent amount of arch support for a fashion sneaker (not as much as a running shoe, but more than those tiny pumas). Love em! Only wish we weren't ankle deep in snow/ice/slush so I could wear them right now",

It fits perfectly, provides excellent support for my breasts and still allows maximum exposure of my breasts (36C) with just a hint of nipple exposure on the top.  The lace is soft and comfortable and allows more than a hint of my nipples to show through any top I wear.  I cannot recommend or say enough about it - if you are not a prude and you like sexy underwear - this is the bra for you",

After using it for about an hour, we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline.  Since I spent over 40 dollars on this blanket I couldn't even throw this away.  I had to haul it around for the entire trip.  I do not think it is worth 40+ dollars.  10 dollars blanket would do the same (or even better) job than this",

It is far superior to the bras I had when I had my first child 4 years ago.  \n\nAlthough it does not have underwire support, it is very supportive (even for my 38DD size).  I switched to nonwire bras, when I found underwire bras to be uncomfortable (blocking milk ducts perhaps).  \n\nAs an added bonus, although it is a full coverage bra, it is quite pretty.  It has nice lace on the top, which looks like a pretty camisole under clothes.\n\nAlso, the 6 columns of hooks are fabulous!  I now believe all bras should have more columns of hooks so we can get more wear out of them.\n\nI would definately recommend this bra.  It is more expensive than some others, but it is worth it",

It looks great under clingy fabrics too; I hate looking \"bosom-y\" and this bra makes me look much smaller than I really am.  I LOVE IT",
