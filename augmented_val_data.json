But they fit perfectly and are suprisingly comfortable, i could wear them all day and my feet won't be sore, its fantastic and they are so hot! i want to get other colours now.",

It's very warm, but you can breathe through it if you use it to cover your face.  It's made from acrylic and polyester, and it is machine washable.\n\nOne complaint I might have is that the edges are finished with stitching that feels rough to the touch.  Also, I would have liked to have seen a few more inches of length.  But it's certainly long enough to use.\n\nOverall, this scarf is nothing to get excited about, and the full retail price seems a bit high, but if you get it on sale, you won't regret it.  It does what you need a scarf to do",

And, I don't need the orthotics!  \n\nThey are extrememly cool and comfortable... suitable for being on your feet all day.  Because of their slight Euro look, they go with almost anything.  In other words, you can wear them with dresses or with gauchos or to the gym.  I've found them in bronze and silver, and lots of other great colors.  They aren't cheap, but a great shoe at that.  These are probably my absolute favorite shoes.  I live in mine and would wear them more often if I had more colors! :)  By the way, I'm in my late 40s and a grandma--though I don't look like it.

I have been trying to find this dang bra for AGES! Finally! I found it again! I am so stoked!  The one I bought so long ago is my favorite bra, and it looks pretty sad by now.  Like other reviewers' bras, mine developed a split in the fabric, but it was only after many, many washes in the machine, rides on the bike, exercise DVDs, naps, etc.  \n\nI like this bra because it fits me so well, but also because the fabric is so breathable--no cotton, so it dries fast!  It is really stable so I actually use mine instead of a sports bra, because sports bras suck.  If I could, I would people the lingerie world with these bras. The only problem a lady might have with this bra is sheerness-related:  Don't wear it with a sheer shirt!  I wish there were another version, \"Opaque Tapestry,\" maybe.  Then I'd never buy any other bra",

        "reviews": "There are several features I like about this product.  Most importantly, the bra supports and yet has smooth lines under silky clothes and the front dips below the waist so you don't have that sausage roll effect where the abdomen bulges when the bra stops.  Another plus is that it comes with clear straps you can use for extra support.  I only have 2 negatives.  First, I believe the ad said it came with both clear AND straps to match the bra but when it arrived only clear was included.  (I didn't pursue this.)  However, the biggest negative is that the cups are not just lined but padded.  I personally find that makes the bra less useful and can even disturb the lines of some clothing.  Sometimes less IS more",

This bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline.  I was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped. The key is to get a propper fit.  I went from a 38C to a 34DD not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra.  If you can pull the band more than an inch from your body, you are wearing the wrong bra size.  It is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place.  It takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight, but I don't bounce, jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore.  I bought two in September 05 and went back and purchased 3 more in October 05, and when these wear out I will purchase the exact same thing.  I hand wash (or machine wash on delicate) after each wearing with a lingerie soap, and line dry.  They still look band new.  I was a little concerned with that itty-bitty plastic front closure bursting, with the band being so snug, but they are still holding \"it all\" together. I was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but I haven't had any tears, rips, runs or poked through any of them yet",

It's beautifully lined and the cute dome buttons are unique. The color (Java for me) was exactly as pictured. The cut is excellent and very flattering to a fuller figure. The shoulder pads (not detachable) are somewhat annoying full, but nowhere near making anyone look like a football player.\n\nFor $24.99, this jacket is definitely worth it -- you would be hard pressed to find a jacket of good quality (cashmere claim not withstanding) for this price anywhere -- at least not one that looks more expensive than $24.99! I would not pay $178 (MSRP) for it, but at the current price, I just might go back and buy another one.\n\nAs for Amazon, I cannot sing enough praises about their excellent customer service!

I would say lost or broken, but Jansport has lifetime warranties! If anything happens to your backpack, all you have to do is mail it to Jansport with a note of the problem, they will fix it for FREE and send it back to you. They will even send you a card while they have it telling you it misses you and will be back soon. Overall, these are such great products, you just have to get a Jansport if you're thinking of a backpack.\n\nAlso, I am in a review writing competition with a friend of mine and if this review is helpful, which I hope it really is, I would love to have your yes vote!\n\nWith Care, \nSa",

        "reviews": "I am a larger guy and needed a light windbreaker-type jacket with a hood that would also keep the rain off my head (that's Seattle for ya).  Since none of the local stores had these in stock I searched Amazon and found this one.  The jacket is of excellent quality and is better than I expected it to be.  It breaks the wind extremely well, and if you really need to bundle up there are velcro strips on the sleeve openings, draw strings around the waist and snaps that go over the zipper.  All in all this is an excellent wind breaker jacket.  It won't keep you warm in very cold weather, but it is one of the best light jackets I've ever owned.  \n\nWhen I placed my order on November 16, 2006 I chose 'standard shipping' and was promised a shipping date of Nov. 20 to Nov. 27.  I received the item on Nov. 27.  I can't say for sure whether I would have received it sooner had Thanksgiving day not fallen within that week, so I won't really complain about the receiving date.  \n\nMy COMPLAINT with the order, however, is this:  From the time I placed my order to the time I received the jacket, the advertised sale price DROPPED by 25 percent, $10.00.  I ordered the jacket and paid $39.95 but by the time I got it, the price was $29.99.  This didn't seem right to me.  I've written to Turfer for a resolution but have not yet received one.  If this is resolved favorably, I'll edit this review.  \n\nExcept for the price dispute, I highly recommend this jacket if you need a light windbreaker type jacket.  It will serve you very well.  Just make sure that you get the right price!! \n\nEDIT:  Still no response from Turfer on the price change, but Amazon's stated policy is that prices and availability may change without notice, so I guess it's buyer beware.  I notice that as of today the price on this item is still $29.99.  I've been using it for 2 months now and I must say it's a fantastic lightweight jacket.  I want to buy another one but I'm afraid the second I order it the price will drop to $19.99!!!",

A year ago I bought one of these shirts in a local store and fell completely in love with it.  It's now a year later, I love it just the same, and I can't find them anywhere, except Amazon (thank God!)  The one I have just happens to have a silkscreen on it, and after a year of constant use (for work) the silkscreen still looks great.  When you compare this shirt to a 100% cotton shirt, these wear MUCH lighter & cooler, even though it says \"heavyweight.\"  Don't let that scare you as it's not \"heavy\" at all.  With constant washing over the last year, the Hanes shirt has kept its color, unlike my 100% cotton shirts of the same age which have faded much faster.  Also, if you tend to perspire, these shirts will wick away the moisture more quickly and will not show it nearly as much as a 100% cotton shirt would.  Also nice is that they don't shrink or wrinkle.  I wish I had known about these shirts years ago...  Don't kick yourself years down the road when you buy one of these shirts by accident and wonder where its been all your life (like I did), get it now and enjoy it",

The KCR men's Team Circle boots were one size larger than stated.  This Simply Western, on the other hand, fits perfectly.  I wear size 7 and ordered a pair of size 7.  Very stylish, very light, very well made.  5 days ago, Dec.6, I went to the M??y's department store and saw the exact same model and brand selling for $145 plus tax.  I purchased this pair at Amazon for $69.90, tax and shipping free!  The pair in the department store have blacken or darkened toe and heel for the brown color model (in which I don't like!).  This brown pair from Amazon have even brown finish throughout.  Looks fantastic, very comfortable, made in Romania!  I give it 5 stars and 2 thumbs way up",

It will add pizzazz to any dress and will make your legs look longer. I looked so much taller than my 5.4\" that I love to look at myself. I received many complments too.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like is that Amazon displays some shoes that are not in stock at all. Why not wait for the stock and then display???

The item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box, looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school!  I am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat. If it was not so cold, I would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing!  The item pills making it look really shabby.  No reports of seams ripped, buttons lost, or holes in the pocket, however, he may be worried that if he tells me about those things I will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money.  It was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself, so imagine his disappointment!  I expected much more of the coat than I got,  and I am looking for a replacement",

I almost considered getting them, but I reminded myself that I was on the hunt for a black patent, pointy toe skimmer. I am *so* glad Macy's did not have the black because I got them thru Amazon for $22.\n\nI believe the shoe fits true to size. I am a 7.5M, period. In pointy shoes, I sometimes go for an 8 or avoid pointys altogether. I was going to listen to the reviews here and order an 8, but I tried on the 8 at Macy's and it was too big. I think it was a bit stretched it given that it was the floor model, but I figured even a brand new size 8 would be too big. \n\nI ordered & recvd a 7.5M. When I recvd the shoes today and put them on they were snug. Not snug in a tight or uncomfortable way. They just fit exactly to my foot. This is a leather upper and not man made. So the patent looks black and shiny! It's not cheap looking at all. The point comes to a nice triangle and isn't exagerrated. Given that they are leather, I expect them to stretch a little to my feet. \n\nThe shoes measures 10.5\" from the point to the middle of the heel. The point to the top of the shoe is 3\" and there is 1\" between my big toe and the point. There is comfortable room to move the toes and because the shoe is leather, it will form a bit to the feet as you wear them. I have experienced that already just walking around the house. The shoe looks low cut on the sides, but my foot stays completely in the shoe when I am walking. I'll be watching to see if I end up with a line/bend across the front of the shoe. By the time that happens -- if it ever does -- I will certainly have gotten my $22 out of them. \n\nAnd finally, I am 5'2\" and I tend to avoid pointy toe shoes because it sometimes looks like I am wearing skis. These shoes are great because they elongate my leg and don't create a costume-y look. They look great peeking out of the jeans I have on and I expect them to look good w/the new capri leggings I got the other day. \n\nHighly recommended!",

It's binder style, so at the very least I knew I would be able to organize pages easily.\n\nThis is a good case overall. The zipper seems good, the binder seems strong, but the handle is a flimsy piece of rubber stitched to the nylon. I bought this case is for storage and not hauling it around so that doesn't matter too much. \n\n I filled it to capacity and to my surpise there is no room to add pages... Also, as with any large capacity binder, flipping pages is not a smooth action, you have to guide the page up and over, and it's hard to flip over any more than 5 pages at a time.\n\nIn Summary:\nPros: stylish, built well, good quality pages (the CD never has  to slide over plastic)\n\nCons: No room for additional pages, hard to flip pages, flimsy rubber handle\n\nI did A LOT of shopping around for a CD case, I'm satisfied this case is better than all the rest I've looked at, but I just think it's possible for all these companies to build a better CD case",

And it has a very nice cotton plaid lining inside that gives the jacket the feel of wearing a coat and not that thin nylon windbreaker feel.  Yet, it seems as light as a nylon windbreaker.  Should it rain, the water rolls right off due to the Teflon coating.  Under the front flaps up to the neck is a netting that allows the coat to breathe and keep things comfortable inside.  The neck area and the zipper flap keep out the wind and rain when it's too warm outside for a heavy coat.  And it's machine washable and dryer safe.  I like how it looks on me and the way it feels wearing it.

I am female, and while wallets are traditionally a male style, I wanted something that wasn't just a coin purse or a typical woman's purse - you know, with the clasp pouch for coins and dividers etc, b/c I find those very cumbersome. This is compact, light, it has plenty of pockets, slots and dividers inside - that zip again comes in handy if you fill up all the spaces inside it ensures you won't lose anything.\nI gave it four stars instead of five just b/c the coin pocket (while strategically placed and pleasingly compact) is a little hard to get your fingers in to put coins in and take them out quickly, it's kind of tight. Also, the center divider (for your pictures or drivers license etc.) sometimes gets in the way when you want to zip the wallet up - like if you are in a hurry to get out of the line at Starbucks and you are struggling to shove your change in the little slot and zip it up!\nBut this really is a great purse/wallet.

        "reviews": "This is a product that every breastfeeding mother needs to know about. Finally a solution to leaking and a way to sleep without wearing a bra! I've been using lilypadz for about a month now and I must say that I LOVE them. When I started breastfeeding my daughter I was using the traditional round cotton pads that you have to put inside your bra to soak up leaks. I hated them because they look terrible under a snug fitting shirt, they don't always absorb all the liquid, and they can shift out of position leaving you with no protection at all. I assumed it was just a necessary evil to breastfeeding because I didn't know something as wonderful as lilypadz existed!\n\nI have to admit, when I first saw them advertised I was skeptical. I didn't think they would stick, I didn't think they would stay in place, and I thought for sure if they did stick that it would hurt to take them off or they'd leave a tacky residue on my breast. I hestitated for a couple of weeks, wanting to try them, but afraid that I'd spend all that money and end up disappointed. It was one morning after waking up soaked because one of my cotton pads slipped during the night I decided I would risk it and order them. \n\nWhen they arrived I read all the instructions and was ready to try them out. Now this is the embarrassing part... in the instructions it specifically says to take them off the plastic dome before using. For some reason I thought they meant take them out of the plastic container. I didn't realize that EACH lilypad was also stuck on a piece of plastic!  When I first tried to put them on I actually tried flipping the entire pad and the plastic dome inside out. (yes it was tough to do too!!) I was frustrated because they obviously didn't stick. I began to think that my fear of them not working was true. Once I realized my stupid mistake, I peeled them off the plastic and tried again. They stuck perfectly!! Try and avoid having the problem I did.. make sure you peel each of them off their little plastic domes. \n\nI was immediately surprised at how secure they felt. I knew right away that I would be able to wear them to bed and not have to worry about one falling off. My next fear was removing them. I carefully lifted up an edge and peeled one off. I was surprised that even though they stuck securely, they peeled off with ease and without causing pain to my tender breasts. I was estatic! What a great product!!\n\nI have found after using them for about a month that there are pros and cons. However the pros greatly outweigh the cons. This is what I have found...\n\nPROS\n------\n1) Attaches securely\n2) Removes with VERY little or no pain\n3) No residue left behind on the breast. Baby can eat as soon as a pad is removed. \n4) Protects tender breasts from rubbing against clothing or sticking to cotton pads. (If you are feeling sore these are a HUGE help.)\n5) Secure enough to stay on all night long without wearing a bra. \n6) Washable and reusable\n7) Invisible under snug fitting shirts. \n8) When properly applied you will not leak\n9) Peace of mind \n10) Quick drying. After cleaning them give them a good shake and you are ready to reapply them (even if they are a bit damp still). No need to buy more than one pair unless you need the peace of mind of a back up. One pair will work and will always be ready to use. \n\nCONS\n-------\n1) If not properly applied you might leak. You must be careful to avoid air bubbles and make sure you apply strong pressure to the nipple when putting them on. However, even if you leak - it won't get on your clothes. Instead it pools up around the nipple. It usually stays sealed. You just have to be sure to remove the pad, drain the liquid, rinse them and then reapply properly. One warning, if you have an air bubble and you leak A LOT it is possible for the pad to loosen and pop off spilling milk on you. This has only happened to me maybe twice after a long night of leaking while sleeping. I leaked during the night, woke up and was feeding the baby from one side without checking to see if I had leaked on the other. My milk let down filling the air bubble more and the pad popped off drenching me.\n2) If you own cats/dogs... keep them AWAY from the pads when you aren't wearing them. They attract fur like crazy. If they do get furry its OK because it does wash off. Its just a pain in the butt and takes a little extra effort\n3) Takes a little more effort to reapply the pad in public (vs shoving a cotton pad back in your bra) but once you get the hang of it, it woudn't even make the con list anymore.\n4) I personally don't wear them every day. I'm one of those types that thinks skin should have a chance to breathe a little. I DO wear them every night, but during the day I'll occasionally wear my  cotton pads so my skin can breathe. I'm afraid that I'll end up with thrush or just pruney nipples if I wore them 24/7. I have no evidence to back up the claim - they may work just fine 24/7. I'd say I wear them 3-4 times a week during the day. I will NOT go a night without wearing them though because I hate wearing a bra to bed. \n\nAs you can see the pros outweigh the cons by quite a bit. The cons shouldn't be enough to keep you from trying them yourself. Even if you plan on wearing them only at night they are well worth the cost. If you are like me and you are skeptical - don't be. These really do work and you will be glad that you gave them a try. Every breastfeeding mother should own a pair and I think they would make a WONDERFUL and unique baby shower gift!",

I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.  Is that not \"Medium\" sized? \n\nI think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  \n\nThe draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.

There's just a couple of quirks, but that could just be me.  When I tighten the straps, they eventually give way and losen up a bit.  I find myself adjusting them every 3-4 wears.  I'm considering sewing the straps permanently at that adjustment. \n\nI hand wash it in cold water with mild soap and hang to dry. Sometimes tumble on low heat or air tumble and the shape and size stay consistent.  I lost just a hair of weight in my breats and the bra fitted a little loser.  Because of this, vertical \"waves\" in the cup material appeared, but that was because there wasn't enough to fill the bra.  Once I gained that size back (unfortunately!) and filled the cup fully, the ridges disappeared.\n\nI've had this one for 10 months and wear it every day, and it's still in great shape! When this one finally gives in, I'm definitely spending the money to buy another one",

A Bank added an extra charge for the trousers to reflect the price of 59.90/pair which I had paid previous to what I assumed was a reduction.  That seems a bit misleading to me, either on the part of Amazon or Jos. A Bank.  Would be nice if one or the other would be completely accurate in their price quotation.

        "reviews": "I did a great deal of research in choosing a case for my new iPod. I decided on the iSkin, and I have been quite satisfied with my decision. I do remember, however, being a bit confused as to just how this case worked. So, to clarify for future buyers, the case is comprised of:\n\n-First, a thin, transparent silicone (rubber) sleeve. The sleeve covers most of the front and back, including a slightly thinner cover where the wheeel would be placed. This ensures that the wheel maintains its touch sensitivity while also being protected. The skin does not, however, cover the screen, and a portion of the back is also exposed to attach an optional belt clip. This sleeve can also come in various colors, but I used the clear one to highlight the natural color of my iPod. \n\n-Second, a hard, clear plastic front plate can be snapped on to the front of the iPod once it is placed in the silicone. This hard case does cover the screen, and all of the front of the iPod, except for a hole for the touch wheel. Once attached, the hard cover is firmly held in place. \n\nPut together, this case provides exceptional protection. The silicone is very thin, yet protects against ordinary dings and scratches. The hard plastic protects the front from impact, and the screen from scratches. The best part for me is that, even with both the silicone and the hard cover, the iPod Nano still retains its very thin size - the case is not bulky in the least. \n\nIn conclusion, I highly recommend this case for anyone who purchases an iPod Nano. Protect your investment",

But since it was on a Friday sale, I ordered the Asian Pear color, which is really a light beige or tan (I thought it might be kind of greenish, but no). \n\nI'm 5'8\", 135 lbs, with broad shoulders and long arms. I ordered a medium. And I'm wearing it right now. The sleeves are plenty long enough, and there is a generous amount of 'give' in the shoulders. I'd say that this shirt almost runs true to size, although a medium certainly doesn't hug me like the medium-sized Brandon Thomas grommet jacket does. A large size in this shirt would have been far too big for me. I probably could have gotten away with a small, but I like this shirt being bit loose. I can wear a shirt underneath it without it being too snug.\n\nThe quality of the shirt (which could really be used as a light jacket) is quite good. It isn't lined, but it is soft to the touch and warm. It snaps closed, so no loose buttons to worry with. \n\nI like it! It isn't tacky-looking in person, but it's definitely different. If it goes on sale again, I will buy another color",

The 700w and p, if you don't know, are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen. The button layout is the same, but they different icons and purposes.

        "reviews": "I ditched the bulky jewel cases for my cds a long time ago in favor of nice binders that would hold the disk and the artwork securely without taking up too much space.  Since my collection continues to grow much faster than I anticipated, I recently started looking to buy more binders.  Alas, the ones I already had (No Boundaries, from Wal-Mart of all places) don't seem to be available anymore, so a pretty exhaustive search of online options brought me to this item.  \n\nBasically, this binder has pretty much everything I was looking for:  three ring construction, a sturdy zipper closure to keep discs safe and contained, and a sewn-in handle at the back so it's portable.  A plus about this particular model is that the rings are slightly oversized for the stated capacity, so there is the possibiity of expanding by buying more sheets.  I bought three, and they work great.  I will buy more - several more, because they are the best option there is at present.  \n\nLet me tell you, however, what I don't like about them.  First, the cover is some sort of plastic or vinyl.  I can see this cracking or disintigrating in a couple of years, even with gentle treatment.  Second, there isn't a proper spine to the binder:  it's basically a single, flexible sheet that wraps around the outside but doesn't make square corners.  That means it will look  untidy on the shelf and also makes me question its long-term durability.  Third, the sleeves:  they are too tight to put the disc and the artwork in the same slot, the ones closest to the rings have their corners notched in to accomodate the rings, and the slits are oriented to the zipper side instead of to the top.   \n\nThose drawbacks aside, I plan to buy more of these.  They are the best choice available now, but I wouldn't hesitate to ditch them if something better became available.  If you are looking for a safe, flexible, and smart place to store a lot of cds, this item should be at the top of your list.",

They have a cotton mesh pouch (sexy, but not really \"see-through\") that is the most comfortable ride my \"boys\" have ever had. \nI absolutley love them/live in them. \nThe Brazilian T-back makes the support across the Netherlands all but unnoticeable while the stretchy sides provide frontal support and all-around comfort. \nPlus, check out the price! \nOMG! \nAnyone who's shopped for a name brand thong knows the average going price is between 15 and 25 dollars.\nAt 8 bucks, these thongs are unbeatable, and if you don't mind the color yellow you can own one for 5. Too good! \nI bought two of every color and am hoping they still make these when those wear out. \nIt will be a sad day in the Underworld when these thongs become unavailable.\nAttention atheltes; added bonus! These are comfortable enough to wear while running, jogging or working-out. \nThe cotton pouch is softer than any jock I've ever encountered (while offering equal support) and the lack of those \"butt straps\" adds an easy 2-3 mph to my runs. \nSeriously (I'm sure it's physcological)! \nTHESE THONGS ROCK. \nPlus, she thinks they are way sexy (bonus-bonus, nudge-nudge) as the pouch was designed and sewn by someone who knows something about the male anatomy and physiology (evoking \"Yeah, Baby, Yeah\" from the Mrs). \nDon't miss out on these - you'll be sorry",

They stretched a bit, but, being silk, not as much as the $3 cotton variety I'd bought at a hippie store. However, these silk shoes are dressier and sturdier, and when they get dirty or smelly, you can throw them in the washing machine. I'm not sure if I was supposed to, but I did and they survived, good as new.",

        "reviews": "We LOVE this sling!!!  Often wonder what we'd do without it as it works it's calming, sleep inducing magic on our son about 99% of the time. It seems like as soon as he gets in he's in his own little cozy womb-like world and he just drifts off... It can be hard on the back in the shoulder blade area, as well as on the shoulder if used for a long stretch of time, but keeping the two layers as spread out (vs. bunched up) as possible generally remedies the problem.  It's easiest (I think) to put the baby in if you guide their head in first, and it's also easy to switch shoulders or the hand baby in sling to another person.  This is our most used piece of baby gear by far - my husband even gardens with it on!  Our son has loved it since he was 4 days old - he's 2 mos now and 15 lbs and there's still plenty of room for him in it. Also, it works well to breastfeed baby while they are in it which is an added bonus when you are out and about. I would also recommened NOT getting a light color (ours was a gift) because it starts looking a little funky after you dribble your dinner down it a few times",

        "reviews": "Recently, I took a motorcycle trip from Atlanta, GA to Ft. Lauderdale, FL. Unfortunately, I didn't have the option of riding at night when it was cooler and with my thermometer on the bike showing between 100 and 110, it felt like riding through an oven with a hair dryer set on high blowing in my face. I also didn't have the luxury of air conditioning so to simulate this so I would pour water on my t-shirt and let the wind cool it down. \n\nAfter getting home, I recalled seeing a demonstration of a cooling vest that you soaked in water for a couple of minutes then wore under a jacket, preferrably mesh. I was amazed at how well it worked in the demo so I went online and ordered one.\n\nThe particular model I ordered from Amazon is the Deluxe Evaporative Cooling Vest in black. It came about a week after I ordered it via USPS Priority Mail. They offer several styles and colors, including some that have removable sleeves\n\nThe outer shell is quilted black nylon with 2 outside, zippered pockets and a zipper up the front. The neck has a velcro closure so it can fit snuggly around your neck if you want. The inner liner is blue and is 100% Nylon Taslan, a water repellant fabric, so it keeps you from getting all wet wearing it. Out of the package, it weighs just a few ounces but when you put it in water, the special material, called Polymer Embedded Fabric (PEF), between the inner and outer shells absorbs water and the vest ends up weighing about 2-3 lbs. You only need to soak it for about a minute. There are spandex panels on either side that allow for some for expansion. I got the Large size and it fits great, not too tight, not too loose. \n\nOnce the water is absorbed, the instructions (on the tag in the vest) say you can wring it out or use a towel to blot the inner liner dry. Not being like a sponge, wringing it doesn't do a lot of good so I'd suggest blotting if you need to. While the inner liner is water repellant, there might be some water on it right after you soak it so putting it on might get you a little wet but if you don't soak it too long, the inner liner will be relatively dry. The material that holds the water doesn't expand like a sponge, it just holds lots of water...it's pretty interesting stuff.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice after a few seconds is that it's cool to the touch. The principle of it relies on the cooling properties of water as it evaporates and it really works. I haven't had a chance to ride with it in sweltering heat yet, but putting it on under my mesh jacket and riding without a windshield kept me nice and cool. I don't think I'd like to try it in anything less than about 65 deg (F) because I'd probably freeze nor would I want to use it under a leather jacket unless there was some way for the jacket to let wind flow through it. The inner liner stays pretty dry but you might get a little damp. The cooling effect will last several hours depending on how long you soak it and if you want to put things in the front pockets, they are lined with the same material as the inner liner so they'll stay relatively dry. One thing I've found though, it'll take several days to completely dry out unless you ride with it. The water is very slow to evaporate but once it does, the weight goes back down to a few ounces.\n\nBottom line, I HIGHLY recommend getting one of these if you routinely ride in hot weather. They're an inexpensive way to keep cool and they're stylish (except for the hi-vis lime green). Wear it under a mesh jacket and you won't know it's hot outside.",

        "reviews": "My search for the perfect gym bag is like my search for the perfect hair drying, yoga mat, organizing products, garlic press (Zyliss) etc. Fortunately, my search for the perfect gym bag is officially over. The Ogio Locker Bag is brilliant and the inventor should get some sort of award. K.R.T. Seeley's review sums it up pretty well, but here are a few things to add. For one thing, the shoe area also nicely accommodates a hair dryer or curling iron. One of the reasons this matters is that it points up a critical advantage of the shelf separating the shoe area from the upper part of the bag: while the shelf is sturdy, it's also adjustable. It goes only low enough to allow for a pair of shoes, but it can also be raised to allow for other items. \n\nNext, while it's very nice that the front end panel has all these handy little pockets for things like shampoo, brush, and whatnot, actually including containers that fit the pockets shows a real consideration for their users. Another plus is the number of outside pockets, several of which are not only zippered but waterproof as well, for, say, wet bathing suits. \n\nBefore I bought this bag, I called my gym and yes, I really did make them go measure the width of their lockers. The magic number was 12\". At 8\", the Ogio bag fits in with room to spare. \n\nFor raqueteers (sports, not crime), there are several loops on one of the end panels for holding racquets and a couple of others I haven't quite figured out yet. \n\nFor yogis and yoginis, yes, the adjustable strap on the end panel can accommodate a yoga mat, if it's not too thick. \n\nAn outer side pocket nicely accomodates my workout journal (yes, I'm a fanatical record keeper), as well as my beloved NewGrips (just do a search on NewGrip) which are indispensable for rowing (notoriously hard on the hands) and weight-lifting (and about a billion other things for those of us with carpal tunnel, arthritis, or, in my case, both). Another outside pocket is perfect for a CD player and headphones. \n\nThe only improvement I can imagine for this bag would be adjustable straps on the bottom to hold larger, rolled towels or mats. Unfortunately, even Title9 doesn't seem to carry that one anymore. \n\nIn other words, this bag is the best on the market. It's a bit pricey but it's worth absolutely every cent. I suspect that quite a lot of my friends will be getting the Ogio for Christmas and birthdays and whatnot. Congrats, Ogio, and thank you very, very much",

The only thing with that is the shoe ran over quicker than I anticipated so I had to buy three more pair. The heel does not last as long as a walking or running shoe from esprit --- that is the only draw back.\n\nSince the inside of the shoe molds to your feet, it will reflect your shoe size if you lose or gain too much weight.  When I lost weight after having my baby, I lost weight in my feet as well and I had to start wearing bulky soxs with my berks instead of stocking.\n\nWhen I first tried on my berks, they were a little tight and slightly uncomfortable but after walking around in them for about two days it loosen up and molded to my feet, -----  once that happened they were very comfortable from then on.\n\nAnother thing I love about it my sister cannot borrow my berks because she says they don't fit her right and they are uncomfortable. We wear the same size shoe give or take a few minor width inches here and there, but because the berks are molded to my feet imprint and my walking pattern she can't wear them comfortable.

They are 100% combed cotton, feel soft and nice, and even the elastic waist band is cotton covered for extra added comfort.\nThe 3-pack of black assorted I received contains 1 solid black pair and 2 pair that are a light green with a very pretty darker design of little flowers and box shapes.They still fit great even after laundering(the instructions say dry on medium but I used low).The price seemed just a little high but they are an excellent quality and have lasted through countless washings.\n\nThis style may also be found at \"Bare Necessities\"  The prices at this time are exactly the same at the 3 sites. What I usually do is check for what the deals are on the shipping charges(this will depend on how much you are spending with each merchant in total) and also, you may find a different variety of colors or patterns at each. Just type in Jockey Elance 3 pack Bikini. This one is style 1449(check editorial description on product page to make sure), and just judging from the reviews of the other styles, these are the best in quality and comfort.\n\nOOOOkay...so even though the world now knows what kind of underwear I wear, it's a product I thought worth a review.\n\nYou NEED these!....Happy Shopping......Laurie",

I also purchased the more expensive black CLAVA ID Holder/Key chain as a gift for a man. If color isn't an issue, stick with the less expensive.  The black was nearly double in cost and it is IDENTICAL in appearance and feel. I am very pleased with the green color. It is a dark green and is very nice. (It would have worked great for the man I purchased it for, had I known what the green looked like) I love this ID/Holder Key Chain bc along with carrying my keys with it, I can carry a lot of things inside such as my Drivers License, credit cards, insurance cards, photos, membership cards, money, receipts, etc. One of the inside ID holders also has a zipper pocket attached so you can also carry loose change. The ID holder also velcros closed, which is a nice feature. There is also one clear plastic pocket on the outside which works perfectly for displaying a photo of my children. I don't think I'd use the outside pocket to hold my drivers licence or another valuable card for fear that it may fall out and get lost. Also, I like carrying my keys with the ID Holder bc I don't have to worry about driving to the store and running in to realize that I forgot my wallet in the car or at home. I like the convenience of having it all together. This is a great buy! Especially for college students. I was first introduced to this style ID holder in college and have been using it ever since",

It is indeed very roomy and I would classify it as a daybag or travelbag because it isn't as limited as most \"lunchbags\", but still great for days at the office. For those of you that are troubled by coworkers \"borrowing\" your food and drinks from the company refrigerator, your troubles will be over with this bag. Tons of room to include cooling packs to keep at least a long day's worth of food and drinks chilly. The top of the bag has a seperate section that will hold all your other daily needs, whether it be reading material, including full size magazines you won't have to roll up or to fit in, medications, keys, cell phone, PDAs and what have you. The other compartments will accomodate you further. Conveniently, there are compartments where you can keep things hidden, so that personal items or valuables don't have to be displayed at any time, unless you choose to do so. This bag appears to be really well made, nothing cheap about it or ill planned. The zipper pulls alone tell the story, large, heavy and solid, accomodating for the smaller hand all the way up to very large men's hands. The stitching appears to be very well done and not prone to come apart easily. The dual handles at the top will allow for carrying with one hand, or clip on the adjustable strap for a more hands free tote. The thickness of the insulation is more than adequate, much thicker than most of the off the shelf type insualted bags, it is what you would expect in a premium bag. The fabric is quality denier that looks like it will be able to hold up to heavy use and easy to wipe clean, like most denier. I would not be surprised to see a flight crew carrying this insulated tote, as it has the style of simple elegance that you usually see with their carryons, suitable for even a daybag phobic male, but sleek enough for a woman to feel as though she hasn't just joined a brown bagger construction crew. This bag doesn't look out of place in the office or at a worksite, the beauty of classic neutral design for the causual person or professional. It has enough capacity to work for a picnic bag for several people. My mother was eyeing it for use to carry all her copious amounts of makeup on her trip to Vegas, with keeping all of it cool in mind. That plot didn't succeed, it has not yet seen Vegas, but nice try mom, lol. The sticker shock for this bag may seem high if you are used to throw away bags from mass retailers, but this is a worthwhile investment for those needing quality and more space. Overall value very high and more than worth the money. Hey, just what the coworkers swipe in a month's time might pay for the whole bag by itself.",

I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32\" waist.  Is that not \"Medium\" sized? \n\nI think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  \n\nThe draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  \n\nAlso, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.\n\nI wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like \"old men's\" underwear.

Great product and a great company",

The magnetic closure is nice so you don't have to hear the sound of velcro ripping every time you want to open it.\n\nMy only complaint is that dust gets stuck between the plastic cover and the screen, but from what I've read that happens with every single case on the market except for the iSkin.

For the first couple of weeks I kept sticking my hand in my pocket to make sure it was still there - it's that unobtrusive.  It's made out of soft, thin leather (so thin, actually, that the embossed lettering on my credit cards shows through the surface).  That might affect the durability, but it certainly keeps the overall bulk of the wallet down.  The illustration shows a large embossed crest, but mine arrived with only discreet lettering saying \"Dopp\" at the bottom - a significant improvement, in my mind.  The wallet has pockets for 3 credit cards and a little pouch, open on the top and one side, to hold your cash.    There's also one additional pocket that's ideal for other documents you just have to carry.  The only slight negative for me was the caramel-colored vinyl lining of the cash pocket.  I don't know why they used such a low-class material there.  It's invisible from the outside, and not really offensive, but if I could change one thing, that would be it.  I debated knocking off a star for it, but the overall function and appearance of the wallet is so excellent that I thought it deserved the full five stars.\n\nOverall, if you're disciplined about what you carry, you'll love the small size and low bulk of this wallet.",

        "reviews": "I just got these sneaks recently.  I am going through the wear-in phase of the shoes.  So these opinions are based soley, no pun intended, on my time with them so far.\n\nOriginally I had gotten a pair of the Jordan Hoops Low.  I loved the style and got a good deal on them.  Well, I found out that 13 in Jordan is more like 11 or 12 in other shoes.  So I had them returned for a 14. I got the 14's and they were long enough..just not wide enough.  It was then that I found out most of the Jordan b-ball shoes are pretty thin width.  \n\nI told the guy that I am willing to look at what they have in the store to just get something that I can try on.  I ended up trying the KG A3 and they felt nice.  I tried on these T-Mac 6s next and they feel better than the KGs overall.  The KGs felt better on the heel, but that was the only place.  Everywhere else, the T-Macs are more comfortable and it is the perfect width.\n\nJust on the shoe...they are hurting my feet just a bit..but that is common for me for the break in period.  I am overweight and flat footed so it takes a while for me to get my shoes comfortable.  They are also warm inside. I am just wearing normal cotton socks right now, not my new Jordan dri-fit socks which wick better. I notice that there are no ventilation holes on the the shoe like most have.  None on the toe area..none on the tongue..and none on the sides.  There is also no meshy fabric to help ventilation either.\n\nOne thing I worry about is the \"stability system\" on the bottom of the shoe.  Long term..it seems like it would be like the Shox system.  My local shoe expert says he gets many returns for Shox that have been torn or worn at the Shox part prematurely but never had any T-Macs back yet.  I guess we will see",

I am a frequent (normally 5+ times a week) endurance runner, and I have found these to be a great addition to my gym bag. Whenever it's too chilly to wear shorts, I'll pull on my Underarmour coldgear leggings and throw my shorts on top of them. Thay keep my legs nice and warm without overheating them.\n\nI also tend to use these as a base layer under everything from jeans to my dress pants whenever it's cold out. Again, they keep my legs warm , but not too warm.\n\nI also like the fit of these leggings. They are tight around the legs, providing good muscle support and compression (good for reducing injuries and soreness), without being too uncomfortable in the crotch and rear (provided you don't wear anything under them -- yes, they are supposed to be worn as underwear). They also have what feels like a synthetic microsuede interior, which just ads to the overall comfort level.          \n\nI have heard a few people complain that underarmour heat gear keeps them a bit too cold, especially when they don't wear anything on top. I like to be slightly cooler when running, so these work for me. If you can't stand being a bit on the cool side, you probably shouldn't leave any part of the tights uncovered (wear something over that completely covers them), but if you don't, yo won't be shivering either",

        "reviews": "I have short hair, not ultra-short, but short, and I find that a few hot curlers can make a big difference in volume on \"bad hair days.\" While I have a full-sized Conair curler set, I discovered that my travel set was really best suited to my hair length. So travel or not, this little set has become a real favorite. \n\nWhat you get \nThe Remington Travel Hair curlers come in a nylon bag with the heating unit build in. The top is clear and fastened by velcro. You pull it open and plug it in to start heating the rollers. On the side of the nylon bag is a smaller, oblong bag holding the roller clips. \n\nThere are five medium rollers (about an inch in diameter) and five small rollers, about 5/8 inch diameter.) There are two sets of clips, pink for the large roller, white for the smaller roller. The clip fits around the roller, and has a tab to aid grabbing it for removal. \n\nThe rollers turn from pink to greyish white when they are heated. They fit into the base over a socket with two prongs. They heat up in about 2 minutes. \n\nHow they work \n\nThe rollers claim to have \"Ionic Technology\" to reduce static and the frizzies. I find that my hair is indeed smooth when I take it out of the rollers. After I let the curls cool, I can style with no frizz. \n\nThe ends of the rollers stay cool to avoid burning your head. They are a bit heavy. \n\nI leave the rollers in for five to fifteen minutes, by which time my hair is well-curled. \n\nUpsides, downsides \nTo keep this set compact, there are only 10 rollers. I could use a few more, even with my short hair. The built-in travel bag is very well designed and compact for a suitcase or small bathroom. \n\nIf you LOSE THE CLIPS, you can find a general replacement style of clip for about $10 at http://www.ballbeauty.com/remington_hair_setters.htm#CLIPS. I dropped two of my white clips and the cats apparently made off with them as trophies of their hunting prowess. So this is helpful to know where to buy more clips. \n\nThe curls last long, though they aren't as stiff as with some of the more expensive, foam covered type of curlers",

I was afraid I'd be doomed to the old 1950s bulletproof, cone-shaped bra-in-a-box styles forever...and those are anything but seductive.(I recently changed bra sizes from one that stores carried in multiple styles/selections to a 34DDD, which you have to order online or have made- at astronomical prices.) I was hopeful about this bra, because it was decently priced~~and I wasn't disappointed. The underwire and 4 hooks give excellent hold, the cups are deep enough to cover everything (and keep things pointing up where they belong), and the criss-cross lacing between the cups gives it just enough of the peek-a-boo allure to make it sexy. Even though this bra is a sedate white, it still passed the husband whistle-test. :) Not bad!",

They are holding up very well in the wash and the  colors match the colors used in baby's outfits on the market - which is very nice. The \"non-slip\" part is the printing on the bottom of the feet that says \"Loveable Friends\". It is a soft rubberish kind of printing that feels very nice to the fingers. We started using these when our baby had just turned 5 months old and they stayed on just as well then. They seem like they will fit her for another few months.

        "reviews": "Be forewarned! Never mind all the mellifluous flubdrub about nature-formed last, footwear classic, nineteen sixty-five, etc. The facts of the matter are that (a) the Irish factory where Wallabees were handmade with love closed down in the late 1990s; (b) the product has been made in mainland China since that time; (c) the materials and workmanship don't begin to come close to their former standards, which is duly reflected in the downward price shift ($180 in 1998 but $110 in 2006, inflation notwithstanding); yet (d) the Web sites--which claim that the shoe is \"even better\"--seem to have no problem with posting photos of the no-longer-available Irish craftsewns while shipping the Chinese hack jobs. Very, very disappointing, gentlemen.  (I once found a fellow in Ottawa who had bought up considerable quantities of sand suede Wallabees and was selling them at a premium--$225--that I was happy to pay, but even he ultimately went out of business, just like Peter, my custom Birkenstock sandalmaker in Germany.)\n\nI once phoned the vendor to complain, and some imbecile tried to explain to me that the product was \"better than ever.\" I flew into a rage, telling her what she could do with her lies. I also chastised her for having the brass-bound gall to lie to me, a diehard Wallabee fan who has continuously owned (and worn, day in and day out) several pairs--sand suede, oakwood suede, brown leather, and/or black leather--since the age of fifteen, two-thirds of a lifetime ago! (The oakwood [= dark brown] suede were always my favorites, since the sand suede always looked a little too smart-Alecky for me, making me look [quite accurately!] like an upper-middle-class New York City Jewish boy--just mate them with Sergio Valente jeans, a creamy velour shirt, and an ultra-expensive sweater.)\n\nAll that having been vented, the Wallabee is still a reasonably comfortable shoe--assuming you can find two members of a pair that actually match within a reasonable margin of deviation! Teenage kids won't know the difference, but baby-boomers will be moved to tears. Get with the program and buy either a pair of those ultra-advanced, computer-designed, ruggedized flip-flops (there are scores of vendors) or some quality suede sneakers (leather ones are far too oppressive for the educated foot).

I am short, have a short midriff, and am overweight, so wider belts would roll from the top down.  I never had that problem with this belt.  Unfortunately, this pregnancy I am entering my 3rd trimester and have finally out grown the 1X belt, and the store I purchased it from is now closed.  I was thrilled when I found this on Amazon.com in a larger size.  \n\nI recommend making it little snug in the mornings and then loosening it throughout the day as needed.  The most appealing feature for me is that this band is completely adjustable to give you the support you need for the different activities you will be doing throughout the day.  Any time you start needing the extra support, just slightly tighten the side straps.  When you start relaxing or if the belt starts feeling a little tight, just loosen it up a bit.  It's quick and easy to work with, and if one side needs more support than the other, just make that one side a bit more snug.  It's AWESOME!\n\nI am a technology education specialist, so I'm on my feet for, many times, 16 hrs a day training and supporting hospitals with their new computer programs.  I couldn't have survived even my First Trimester without this belt.  I raise it a little higher in the back so that I have complete lower back support and belly support.  There were days when I forgot to wear my belt that I almost couldn't walk after only 4 hrs of work due to lower back pain that would eventually extend down to my fanny and legs.  My legs would litterally give out from underneath me until I could rub and relax my lower back for a while.  When you are working with doctors in the surgery room or doing rounds with them this is NOT a good thing.  As long as I wore my belt, I NEVER had a problem.  \n\nI strongly recommend this product",

I have to say that although I hesitated to spend 100 bucks on a robe, when it got here and I wore it for a couple days, I really like it.\n\nI bought the Large Black robe; I'm 6ft, about 200lbs, a little heavy around the middle, and the robe fits pretty well.  The arms are baggy and the sleeves are long enough to touch the back of my hand just after the wrist.  The length extends to just about the bottom of my calf muscle in my legs.  It \"flows\" nice too, when I walk, not like the heavier terrycloth robe.  And the silk lining makes me feel \"rich\"!\n\nOverall, I like it",

Hands down this was the best purchase - even better than the $65 I spent on the Le Mystere bra. It is unbelievably comfortable and since I am a \"light\" 34c it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect C. Plus it gives me a \"bump\" and just the right amount of cleavage. I can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top. One thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together - and since I am 5' 1\" and a size 2 that works well for me as I am pretty small framed. It took a bit to get used to \"them\" being so \"out there in front.\" So if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you.

They take on every bone, every curve, every nitch. The next thing you know, it's like wearing a glove. Perfect shoes that seemed to be made just for you. As they age, they eventually start to smell, and you replace them and repeat the whole process.\n\nI love these shoes. However, they do not love me. After years of wearing them, the lack of arch support finally did me in... I developed foot problems that rendered walking impossible for a few days. The pain lasted months.

The contrast lines around it simply call more attention to your more prized areas, so its really nice.\n\nOf course, the pouch is this size because of the general loss of material elsewhere in the trunk to make this \"no-show.\"  I had no problem with this being no show, wearing my lowest-rising jeans with it.  Basically this underwear is meant to be fully appreciated when you are not wearing your pants :)\n\nFor me, this trunk was not uncomfortable, given its diminished size and intent to be no-show.  Granted, in those moments of excitement, things do get a little more - eh, crowded.  But a pleasant side effect is that it will look herculean in size if you are only in your underwear.  I did not experience much more discomfort than I did in any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk.\n\nThis pair is made of 100% cotton, so those of you who do not appreciate the synthetic materials from the X-Factor line may enjoy this feature.  My only complaint is that the leg openings (also contrast) do not \"cling\" to me as stongly as the waistband since they are not made of elastic or nylon, etc.  But that is just minor.\n\nThe waistband is, as always, a remarkably soft material mix and a more discreet height, in keeping with the no-show design.\n\nI cannot reccommend this trunk enough, and within hours, it became my favorite 2(x)ist product in my collection",

The front pouch conforms to your bulge perfectly and has the right amount of fabric to completely cover & cup your balls, unlike other thongs and jocks on the market that leave some uncovered space.\n\nI love the textured look and feel of the ribbed mesh pouch while the support is consistent and comfortable.  The thin colored waistband offers a great look when compared to the excessively wide waistbands of other jocks.  The straps that go around your cheeks give you the same feel as other jocks.  Just keep in mind that the straps of a jock offer a different feel from that of thong-type underwear, so it may take a little getting used to if you're not accustomed to wearing a jockstrap.

I wear a size 12 (sometimes a 14) and ordered a Large the first time. They fit perfectly, though I had to pin the part around the ankle to keep it from being so blousy. I noticed that complaint on other reviews, but it's easy to pin it from the inside and remove some of the fullness. The slimness in the hips and the comfortable fabric completely make up for the ultra-fullness at the ankle. I get compliments on them everywhere I wear them and I can dress them up or down, with flats or heels, with no problem. I did make a mistake when I ordered the second pair and got an XL. I washed them on hot and dried them very hot, as well. They actually fit fine and are really comfortable--but I'll order the Large again next time, for sure. I'm going to order all the other colors available, and maybe even a second pair in the olive green since I wear them so much. They'll never go out of style. They're perfect for airline travel because you can put your boarding pass and I.D. in the pockets, while sending your carry-on or purse through the conveyor-belt security. I love these pants!",

        "reviews": "I recently got a 15\" MacBook Pro and needed a larger bag to accommodate it (replacing my Manhattan Portage 1640 Waxed Canvas Messenger Bag, which I loved). I ordered and returned several things before settling on this. I am very happy. It is a durable, smartly designed bag, and pretty much a perfect fit for the MacBook Pro, stored inside of a sleeve case. \n\nAt first I thought I would replace my Manhattan Portage bag, which was just barely too small for the MacBook Pro, with the bigger version of the same bag, the 1635. But that bag was WAY too big- the MacBook was swimming in there. This bag is a comfortable fit, with a little room on either side of the MacBook when the bag isn't too full. And there is plenty of room to carry a number of regular books (or whatever else) in addition to the MacBook.\n\n It also has an ideal number of smaller pockets - not too many, not too few - for storing accessories. For my needs, the pockets are intelligently placed and sized so I feel like there is a place for everything, and I don't feel like there are any useless pockets.  Most of the smaller pockets are inside the main compartment, on the side opposite the one that's against your body when you're wearing the bag. This makes them convenient to access while the bag is on. And one problem I had with the Manhattan Portage bag was that the smaller pockets were on the side that's against your body, so whatever was in the main compartment of the bag would get in the way of accessing the smaller pockets. Since these are on the opposite side, the pockets are easy to get to even when the bag is relatively full. \n\nOne of the pockets has a key ring, but unlike some bags, this one is attached to a long \"leash\", so the keys can actually sit at the bottom of the pocket until you need them. They don't get in the way when you are trying to get other things out, but when you do want them, you just fish them out by grabbing the top of the \"leash\". \n\nA waterproof liner was an essential feature when I was searching for a bag (I'm paranoid about being caught in a downpour with my laptop), and although this one hasn't been put to the test yet, it seems even better than my previous bag, which always kept the contents dry. One problem with the Manhattan Portage bag was that when the flap was closed there were gaps at the top on both sides, near where the shoulder strap attaches. Although this bag has a similar design, it doesn't seem to have the same problem. \n\nI do wish this bag came with a shoulder pad for the strap, but that is my only complaint and I'm sure I can purchase one separately. And the price on Amazon is significantly cheaper than I could find anywhere else, so I can put my savings toward the shoulder strap",

        "reviews": "After reading quite a few negative reviews for this bag, I thought I would write a review to clarify something. This is a messenger bag, not a backpack. A messenger bag was and is never meant to hold all the items a backpack can. So basically, if you're using this bag for school purposes, keep this in mind. This bag can hold items for possibly up to 3 classes. So while it's perfect for a college student who might have a class, then another class right after it. This bag would be horrible for a high school student, who might have to drag home texts for six classes.\n\nOf most messenger bags, the Elefunk bag is probably going to be your best choice, cause of its size and number of compartments. We have 3 of these bags, 2 of which are used for education, and the third is used as a utility/diaper family bag. For education, as I stated before, it's best for college students. The main compartment is spans out and can hold 2 college texts, binders, and study guides snug. Keyword there is snug, cause it's not big enough to carry more. Inside the main compartment is a little sleeve held tight by a velcro patch. I use this to keep my study guides from my texts. Okay, next comes the the front pocket attached to the main compartment. This compartment is big enough to fit my 12 inch iBook in a neopreen cover, or a 13 inch MacBook bare. Warning, if you place your MacBook in this pouch, careful how you toss this bag around, cause it offers no padding and is very unforgiving. Inside this front pouch is a zippered sleeve fine for putting loose change or maybe id cards or what not. Next to the zippered sleeve are two pouches for pens and pencils, even a TI calculator, that is if you're not planning on putting your notebook in that pouch. Don't worry though, cause attached to that pouch on the outside are two zippered compartments opposite one another to the front pouch. On one side I put my black leather data file, and on the other side, I put my TI-89 calculator. Then that leaves the flap, which is secured to the bag using strong plastic clips. On the front of the pouch is a zippered compartment. Which I pretty much can only use it to pack up a couple magazines to read, if I'm waiting between classes. You can also use it to pack up headphones or earbuds, to listen to you iPod or whatever. As for the shoulder strap, it's about as comfy as it's going to get. Keep in mind, you're lugging 20 to 30 pounds of books and supplies, it's not suppose to feel like a Chinese massage. But I can't complain.\n\nAs for a family bag. Eh, I wouldn't suggest this to a newly mother who wants to go down to a mall. Cause stores will not let your take this bag in there. But if you're on a trip, or going on a flight, this bag is excellent. You can pack away all your babies needs, and other essentials.\n\nAnyway, I just didn't like seeing a product I use, and like, getting knocked, cause a couple people misjudged how to use it properly. Again, if you're taking more than 2 or 3 classes at a time, this bag isn't for you. But if you're a run of the mill college student, who takes a class or two at a time, then goes home. This bag is a must",

I loved it so much, I bought the ivory, black, and cassis (a dark burgundy).  This was a good thing, because my six-year-old daughter cabbaged onto the first one.  Imagine that: A scarf a child actually *wants* to wear.  I love this scarf so much, I'm going to buy the other colors I don't have yet.\n\nWe had a very cold, windy winter this year, and I wore one of these scarves every day.  They kept me warm without being oppressively heavy.  They also roll up into almost no space at all, so they're ideal for travel or having in your bag \"just in case.\"\n\nThe scarf is 100% acrylic, and the one drawback is that it's dry-clean only.  I suspect handwashing would be okay, though.  Even if you have to baby it a bit, it's worth it for the exquisite texture.\n\nI highly recommend this scarf.",

I am back tonight to order another pair in a different color now that I know they are worth the money I paid for them. Plus the fit was perfect.  I noticed others here said their large was to big so get a smaller size...and another person said the opposite.  (That confused me when I went to buy.) So I just went with my husbands normal size which is a XXL and it was absolutely perfect!  :)  My husband loves the feel of them and said this is by far is nicest pair of PJ's ever.  \n\nThe size is perfect, color bright & looks like it will hold up after many washings. Seams looked like quality sewing unlike some I have bought in the past.  I can't find anything I don't like about these.  \n\nI need to get another pair here FAST before he wears these out. lol  Anyone thinking of buying these I can't help but think you will be quite pleased to say the least. \n\nJa",

I was fitted for this bra before I bought it, but the store didn't have my size so I started looking for the bra online.  I ordered exactly the size that I was fitted for, received my two bras, and the fit was terrible. The bra is too tight, and the cups don't fit.  I'm not spilling out over the sides of the bra, usually the first indicator that the bra doesn't fit, there's all this extra material in the center of the cup.  \nAside from my fitting problems there are two other problems with this bra I'd like to point out.  Being full figured there are two things necessary to support bigger chests.  First, a bra band that is wide and has four hooks on it, this bra does not have that.  Second, you need wide, supportive straps, again this bra does not have wide enough straps. There are better bras out there.",

Anyways, I bought it, shipping charges and all on the 18th. Later on, I go to Amazon because , when I'm bored I go to Amazon, lol. Imagine how annoyed I was when I saw it was the same price, but as you know Amazon has FREE SHIPPING on products over a certain amount, ALWAYS. I figured what's done is done, but I revisit laurensilva.com, and see in bold print FREE SHIPPING Dec 15th- 31st on orders over $50. I'm happy cuz I'm thinking, \"Great I didn't overpay\", I call customer service and she tells me \"Oh, I'm sorry about that that was a mistake on our part that should've said 19th not 15th\" then goes on to say \"My supervisor will call you to let you know about the refund tomorrow.\" Received no call. I call the next day around two to hear from the supervisor that even though THEY put the 15th, it was an error and shouldn't have been there, and he wouldn't refund me the 5 bucks. How am I responsible for an error from YOU GUYS. Isn't that FALSE ADVERTISING? I'm so pissed. Now I have to call my credit card company, and might have to deal with them lying about it. I'm so angry.\n\nAside from being deceived, I was treated so poorly. How do people act like this? When I initially called, I had no idea it would turn into this, otherwise I would've had \"gathered evidence.\" as my friends tell me. I hate to make a stink over 5 measly bucks, but you should've heard his condescending attitude when he said \"We won't be refunding you the shipping, but thank you for informing us of the error\" . Right now it's simply the principal",

The only difference between this one and other belts of similar design that I've seen is that they all seem to have logos, either engraved or cut out. I don't enjoy sporting I giant logo on my waist. I much rather get what I want AND pay less for it. \n\nThe buckle is not a design that opens and closes, rather you slip the belt through the buckle and tighten it by sliding a metal bar foward. If you close it tightly enough, it will hold a LOT of weight, far more then the open/slip belt through/close buckle on belt design. I carry a bunch of things on mine, including a heavy multi-tool, a knive, a phone, several pouches filled with a various manner of junk, a tape measure, and occasionally heavy construction tools. Granted the belt wasn't meant for this kind of weight but...normally after a few minutes my old buckle would just pop open from the weight...no such problem here. \n\nIt opens and closes without trouble and will fit a large waist easily. What more do you want from a belt?! =) \n\nAndrew Christian were speedy enough in shipping it; it came a few days after my Amazon order, which was 3-5 business days. Great deal",

In my oppinion people shouldn't be allowed to use brand names like \"Ray-Ban\" if the product they sell is not that brand in particular. I guessed it by the price, but still, I thought, maybe was some crazy clearance, or who knows why. The package got here in excellent conditions. The seller offered a full refund, but I kept them to remind me of my mistake... So, the product's description is confusing and tricky... I am not happy with my purchase, but I hope I learned a lesson: \"nobody sells $100 bills for $20\"",

The two sets of PJs from Carole fit the bill entirely. I've been using them every night since they arrived. And they can be thrown in the washer and dryer and still look and feel great. They are the most comfortable PJs I have ever owned.",

I did read the other reviews that warned of a need for \"breaking in\" the sole nubs and wearing socks during that process. However, I've worn these slides for 2+ months and they still make the soles of my feet tender unless I continue to wear socks.  I am disappointed in the slide but I will stubbornly continue to wear them. Maybe some day they will be \"broken\"",

Branded \"Marc Wolf LTD\", \"Made In America\" and \"Top Grain Cowhide\" on the inside. The finish on the leather and the buckle was good with no defects, nicks, or burrs.\nA couple of notes to help you buy.\nSize:\nThe size of the belt seems to be to the center of five belt holes.\nThe five holes span 3 1/2 inches total, so you should be able to go about 1 3/4 inches larger or smaller than the size you ordered.\nExtra holes:\nTo make extra holes a hand held leather punch will work fine. If you are comfortable with power tools you can also drill new holes as needed. Place the belt (finished side down) on a chunk of scrap wood, drill from the back (unfinished inside) side of the belt for best results. Have a friend help you as the leather will try to lift when the drill bit goes through. I had to do this as I ordered 2 inches bigger than I measured just to be safe. \nI am very happy with this product",

When she walks in a store...we always know where she is.  The best part is that walking in to places everyone looks around to see where the sound is coming from.  People can't help but smile when they see her squeaking along.  Beyond being fun - these shoes are terrific.  They have a nice wide toe box and they are easy to put on.  They are very sturdy and a great value considering many discount stores sell shoes that are higher priced for less quality and that is if you can find the shoes.  These are absolutely the best combination of good value for the money",
